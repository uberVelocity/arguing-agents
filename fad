general literature on argument mining
unique thing: argument mining on procon and on reddit and compare
one corpus being used on two different data sets
careful in describing the method since they are different mediums 
separate steps. Do it in two projects.  and then combine the results
Think of a criteria of things that work nicely for procon.org. Same for reddit (things that work nicely and things that don't work). Apply this set of criteria to both.
Also mention the next step.
Better keep at what we have than do more.
The report that we write is the core of how we are graded.
