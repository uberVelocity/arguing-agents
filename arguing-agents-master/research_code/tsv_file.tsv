medical marijuana				> a quick google search will show you reputable evidence that it can be used to treat everything from seizures to PTSD.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is what I get hung up on...if marijuana has legitimate medical uses, why doesn't it go through the FDA, get prescribed by doctors, and dispensed at a pharmacy like any other substance that treats a medical condition?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And why are all other drugs a pill or injection but marijuana is the only "medicine" you light on fire and inhale the smoke of, with multiple versions to choose from with psychedelic names?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it's real medicine, it should be treated like a real medicine...or if it's a recreational substance that is just a safe-enough way to chill out and enjoy yourself, then stop making medical claims.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				As I recall it came out of a sterilized, medically approved canister and was administered by a health professional.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Epidiolex sounds like how marijuana-adjacent medication should be handled, and marijuana should be federally decriminalized so we can study it more.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And until then, like all other substances, we should avoid making unapproved medical claims about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Earlier you said it needs to be decriminalized federally to get treated like a real pharmaceutical, that's what I'm saying needs to happen.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And the studies so far are far from conclusive...and even if they were, they're not FDA approval like any other medicine has, so we shouldn't be making claims about marijuana treating anything yet.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Got it, do you believe that there have been appropriate studies conducted to allow us to confidently make specific medical claims about marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That would be tantamount to saying "FDA approval means nothing for pharmaceutical effectiveness" which seems patently absurd.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The studies I've seen for marijuana helping treat various ailments are often tragically small.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Another poster linked a few different papers where the sizes were never over double digits.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And most were less than a dozen subjects.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				That would definitely help change my mind about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The only thing I found related to marijuana and opiods was  [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/26/12624) paper challenging the idea that availability of marijuana helped the opioid crisis.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				[This page](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy) from epilepsy.com talks a lot about the pros and cons of cbd and thc treatment for epilepsy and appears (to my cursory glance) to be thorough and minimally biased.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				!Delta  Glad to see there's some actual solid research and genuine evidence with that one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I hadn't heard of it actually treating epilepsy like that and I agree that the source seems to be unbiased.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It even has some side effects called out which goes against some of the claims people have made suggesting it has no side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No medicine is without them and the fact they found side effects goes a long way to proving its authenticity and usage as a real medicine.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				It appears based on a quick review of the abstracts of recent research that interest in this question arose in the early 2010’s, but there were only low-quality studies showing no effect until more recent moderate-quality studies started showing an effect, however, the effect appears in patients also taking other drugs and disambiguation of which drug does what is impossible.

medical marijuana				Actually, the juxtaposition of “physical” and “psychological” dependencies have been abandoned as far as I’m aware.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Addition is addiction, so to speak, and marijuana does have the same rate of addiction as alcohol among its regular users (10%), for comparison.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Aren't you arguing against yourself?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				6.2% is among all Americans, not just regular users, and the addiction rate is obviously going to be higher among regular users, I read the 10% estimate the other week, but don't remember the source.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol is more common, but we're talking rates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The rates of addiction among regular users of alcohol and marijuana appears to be about the same.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>The number of things marijuana supposedly can treat is staggering.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Cancer  Marijuana cannot treat cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People only talk about pain relief which isn't cancer treatment, its an abatement of symptoms, which yeah it does help with chronic pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anxiety and headaches both fall under this umbrella as well, the drug literally makes you feel less in general.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Granted, I would say that the anxiety element is equally treated by other drugs that act as a social lubricant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(I.E. Alcohol.)  Also, unlike Marijuana *snake oil* actually did nothing back in the day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana wasn't a controlled substance for 80+ years because *it does nothing.*	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of the snake oils back when were basically  heroin, morphine, and alcohol mixed with various other flavorings or nonsense that didn't do anything.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So they did *something*.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think your point about alcohol honestly solidifies my belief further, alcohol could be claimed to do many of the things that weed does.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People have used alcohol for pain relief for years!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That doesn't make it a good solution for pain relief.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>alcohol could be claimed to do many of the things that weed does  &#x200B;  Yeah, but not without a hangover	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Weed absolutely gives a kind of hangover.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You feel like the sleep you just had did nothing and you feel stupid for the next 12 hours like your not all there and that's probably because weed directly impacts your REM sleep	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's only a thing the first few times you smoke, it's called a green day.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				>  the drug literally makes you feel less in general  Doing that safely is the purpose of a lot of drugs, and Marijuana is one of the safest ones out there.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are substantial communities of people who do beleive that it will cure cancers and pretty much any other malaise you can suggest.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most facebook groups on this topic propagate this nonsense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most people advocating for medical marijuana don't think it's a "cure-all," they just think it's helpful for a few things - which is demonstrably true; it has certain benefits.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's different from snake oil, which I'm imagining had none of the uses it was purported to have	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				First, they're not snake oil because people aren't selling it as a cure-all, pro-weed people on the internet just lie about the benefits of it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Second, it isn't even sold as a medicine most of the time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some people justify it like that because they still feel stigmatized for doing it, but weed is used recreationally most of the time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone said beer cured cancer, it wouldn't make beer snake oil, because most people aren't buying it for cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I'm sure some people might use it as an excuse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Third, there are SOME medicinal qualities, just not as much as some will have you believe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One benefit is that it helps your appetite if you don't eat right.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not sure I even need a source for that one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[It can be used to treat pain.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2338266)    [It possibly helps with PTSD, but more studies are needed.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578915/)   [There are studies that mention a possible treatment for seizures, the studies say that their data is largely anecdotal, but positive.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911937/)  [There's an observational study on Parkinson's.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Small sample size, but it was positive.](https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Abstract/2014/03000/Cannabis__Medical_Marijuana__Treatment_for_Motor.1.aspx)	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People on the internet, and in person constantly lie about it, especially when it comes to votes for legalization of medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is the problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is pushed with wild claims often by people who don't actually suffer from the ailments that they claim it helps with.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But a friend of a friend said that it helped and so they make the claim that it helps.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Many distributors will point to anecdotal evidence because they legally cannot make any claims about its uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also I think it is still a problem for it to be pushed when you only have small, anecdotal research on its uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I claimed a literal oil made out of snake venom drank three times each day cured my anxiety should we start telling people that literal snake oil is a cure for anxiety?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Placebo can do that much for some people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Isn't it the exact opposite with alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact that alcohol is widely available, and known to be extremely damaging to your health and potentially people close to you (because of the way alcohol makes some people behave).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We as a whole seem to shrug off the realities of alcohol like they dont exist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So those people spewing crap about weed that isnt true just to "gain some ground" isn't really relevant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have alcoholics ruining their life, but cant accept or admit that to themselves when they are told it is happening to them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But they can walk down the street and buy it, no prescription needed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think it will be possible to change your mind unless you personally have an anxiety attack, nausea, pain, etc and smoke a lil.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can't accept it just because you can't relate to it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have had anxiety for years and had an anxiety attack while smoking weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can absolutely relate and ultimately even if it did help, that's still only anecdotal evidence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some people will claim dousing themselves in peppermint oil cured their anxiety.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That doesn't make it a cure that should be pushed to people who are suffering.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not until there are actual studies with scientific rigor that prove that it truly and consistently fixes the problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> that's still only anecdotal evidence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The diagnosis of anxiety and depression is based on technically anecdotal evidence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The existence of either even is technically based on anecdotal evidence and there are even people who use this argument to claim they do not actually exist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>I can absolutely relate and ultimately even if it did help, that's still only anecdotal evidence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What about the research in [this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319622.php)?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The sample sizes may be small but that's a matter of research dollars and stigma which are rapidly changing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				10, 12, 49, and 1 for the sample sizes?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Those are pretty small and most of them were for very short term anxiety, not long term.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I have no problem with something being used as a treatment once proven, but pushing it before large studies are done is irresponsible.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Does any medicine treat anxiety long term, or is it all used for in the moment or as maintenance	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've used Buproprion prescribed by my doctor to great success to treat my anxiety long term.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you're just looking for short term anxiety relief alcohol could be argued to work as well or better than weed, but prescribing someone alcohol to get over anxiety sounds nonsensical doesn't it?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You keep mentioning that alcohol can be said to treat the same things as marijuana, so why prescribe marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think the main reason is that alcohol is one of the most damaging drugs on the planet, while marijuana has very few adverse side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, both marijuana and alcohol can lessen pain and anxiety, but why choose to prescribe alcohol (or opiods for that matter), which are highly addictive, and highly damaging to the body, when you can prescribe marijuana which is relatively safe in comparison?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But isn't the medicine only effective because of consistent, long-term use?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				CBD is also used by many consistently for similar results.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I am not saying it will cure major anxiety disorders, but the idea that other anxiety treatments are different because of the longevity is just a matter of practice rather than trait.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's purely anecdotal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Again all the research that has been done with any measurable amount of data were making claims for short term anxiety, not long term.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Many of the ones you linked said that they make no claims as to the benefits or negatives of long term usage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If there is actual proven evidence and research that says it's useful in the long term that would help change my mind about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But without that you might as well say that sugar pills help with anxiety when used long term.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And medications that are pushed for anxiety are basically pushed with a shotgun approach.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should they just not reccomend anything?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Research is done first to determine whether over a large sample size the medicine works.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it is proven to work in a statistically significant number of cases, then it may be prescribed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not guaranteed to work.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The idea that weed should be added to the list of potential perscriptions based on tiny sample sizes and when only short term results were measured is rash and irresponsible.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				xanax has a huge potential for abuse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				doctors are handing it out like candy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				and the average person taking even 1mg of xanax will most likely not even be able to function, and may even "brown out", you basically black out, but just in your mind.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You wake up the next day having no clue wtf happened, not realizing you were in zombie mode the entire day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its insanely strong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most people that are prescribed it dont need it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At least not that strength.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Feeling anxious is just like any other feeling.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its normal to feel anxious.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not every feeling that makes people 'uneasy' needs to be addressed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We feel these things for a reason.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But when they do have to be addressed, it should be with a firecracker, not a nuclear bomb.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How many of those medicines that have all that research behind them end up causing irreversable damage to tons of people resulting in class action lawsuits that dont touch the profits that the pharmaceutical companies made by promoting drugs that research showed was safe, but clearly wasnt.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And they spend all that money on that research because they can sell a product that people cant hope to grow themselves and pharmaceuticals companies can profit off of big time...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And they dont even have to list the fillers in their pills!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They do research on the active chemicals and then prescribe medicine that doesnt necessarily even have the same fillers in it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				On the other hand, they arent going to pour that money into researching something that I could grow in my living room, isn't synthesized, and has been used for thousands of years without anybody noticing any major health effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Thousands of years of use, a few years of research for the purpose of making a boatload of money for a dishonest industry...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I dont understand your opinion	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> How many of those medicines that have all that research behind them end up causing irreversable damage to tons of people resulting in class action lawsuits that dont touch the profits that the pharmaceutical companies made by promoting drugs that research showed was safe, but clearly wasnt.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The existence of other drugs that turned out to have negative effects is irrelevant to the topic at hand.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sample size is relevant to what you are looking for.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These studies are not FDA phase 3 clinical research studies, those are not easy to perform because marijuana is a schedule 1 drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(Although clinical research studies start out with 10-100 sample size anyways).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These studies are feasibility studies to first prove that something is likely safe and that it is feasible to be used to treat a certain condition.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As such, these studies are more than sufficient in sample size.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For example, FDA Early Feasability Studies (EFS) and Feasability Studies for medical devices use a recommended sample size of 10-15 and 20-30 respectively.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You cant just blindly say "they didnt use a large enough sample size that means the study results are wrong..."  These studies, and others, prove that marijuana/CBD can be used to treat various ailments or symptoms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The next step that you are thinking of would be to test on a larger scale specifically to test for things like safety, dosage, side effects, and long-term adverse reactions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unfortunately, that process is harder to do in the U.S.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				right now.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Overall I agree that there are people claiming it is a cure-all when it is not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But to deny the health benefits that do exist because of your misconceptions about sample size is asinine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pretty much exactly.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				They didn’t cure my PTSD or completely fix all of my sleeping problems, but I get far more sleep now than I did before using them, and it’s usually better quality too.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So I’m thankful for the CBD patches, even if it is just a placebo effect (I don’t think it is tbh).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Firstly, apologies for being late to the party and for the length of my post but I wanted to be thorough in my personal experience with your subject matter.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of posters have provided hard data so I won't burden you with repeats on that but wanted to share a personal(anecdotal) example of how it's helpful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In this case I'm supporting the use of CBD oil along with a mix of that with varying strains of THC oil.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My grandmother is 97 and has dealt with arthritis pain for most of her senior years and later developed fibromyalgia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It has been steadily worsening with some extreme flare ups as her body has been understandably aging.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you aren't aware of what that disorder does, it impacts how the central nervous system processes sensation and most notably will cause the person to be in extreme amounts of pain which can be widespread or localized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my grandmother's case, she experiences constant nerve pain all over her entire right side on a constant basis which she'd classify as a 7/10 on her pain threshold.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Additionally, there are temporary bouts of pain that flare up to a degree that has her crying, doubled over in her chair or constantly getting up, trying to walk around, sitting back down on repeat for most of a day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She's put this pain at a 15/10 on what she can handle.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They are also exacerbated by her emotional state so if she gets stressed or anxious, mere seconds after she'll experience a wave of pain well beyond that constant 7/10.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a result of her conditions, my gran has been on nearly every pain and arthritic pill available on the North American market.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She also has access to stronger opioids to manage the pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The side effects of her long term use of these medications ranged from all sorts of digestive issues (ulcers, diarrhea, general indigestion) which of course then required other pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The opioids specifically will put her in a near asleep but not state for the entire day, dehydrate her and residually leave her feeling disoriented for quite some time after.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With all of that, they really don't get rid of her pain either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The way she explains it is that it muffles it a bit but the opiate effects end up as a layer sitting on top of her pain (Quoting her words here).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We tried CBD oil as a last resort because her suffering from the side effects of her medications was escalating to the point of being almost as bad of a burden as the conditions they were trying to manage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While the first month did not provide much results as we were very cautious with dosage, once we increased it to a certain threshold it was like a switch flipped.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				On her better days, she currently just needs to take the CBD oil consistently.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She has stopped taking any of her other medications because CBD has made it possible for her to enjoy a quality of life for the most part to not need them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, as her condition has worsened which it will continue to do as she keeps getting older, we have had to tweak the when and how of giving her CBD along with having to start mixing in varying amounts of THC oil as CBD on its own isn't enough for the higher threshold of pain she experiences or the volume she'd need would make it to difficult for her to safely get around.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The small "bump" of THC seems to directly hit the higher threshold pain, while the CBD continues to help that constant lower non-stop pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She still rarely needs to take anything else to get through her day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To wrap this up, while yes this is anecdotal, the effects and benefits are something I can see replicated daily and most importantly, it eliminated the need for a daily drug cocktail that wreaked havoc on her body which IMO is the biggest win for her here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My last point here is that I periodically use CBD for bouts of anxiety induced insomnia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It has been tremendously helpful in providing a more relaxed state of mind in an often fight or flight response at the most inopportune time compared to things I used to reach for which were sleeping pills or alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Let's just say I learned a hard lesson with those two, while post CBD I wake up feeling normal and fresh.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I do agree with you in one aspect of your post being that the "wave" of benefit claims for CBD and medical weed are getting ridiculous, to the same effect that I used to see posts for apple cider vinegar and its 25 benefits listed coincidentally right after a post of lavender oil and the 25 benefits it also cures.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, I think that we still have plenty of actual discoveries to make concerning how CBD and weed can in fact be a helpful tool.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If there's anything you are interested in for me to clarify there, please let me know.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>If you ask people who support medical marijuana they'll tell you all of those and more can be cured by regularly smoking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Literally every use of medical cannibas I have heard of is not smoked at all, but ingested, and it also is reduced in the amount of THC which is the part that gets you high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of plants have medicinal properties we wouldn't expect.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While I completely agree with you that it's used often as an excuse by people who just want to justify weed smoking, I do honestly believe marijuana can help with several things.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Two examples I can think of that you didn't mention are its soothing effects on Parkinson's symptoms, and its effects at naturally lowering intraocular pressure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My doctor mentioned it to my parents when I was 3 almost 26 years ago as a potential means to help.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Of course it wasn't done then, and I don't smoke anything, fags or weed, but I still think it holds an important place for those who need its help	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Using pot saved my life.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And it wasn't my idea.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In fact, before I was an inactive but rather staunch LDS member (ex, now) who never had any desire to try pot whatsoever, or alcohol, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was told to start using pot by my doctor when she sat me down and said 'Your medications are causing liver and kidney damage and your blood pressure is insane as a side effect.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have three choices here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can stop all your medications and you will be non functional in a year and dead from suicide in three.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can keep on your medications and be dead in between two and ten years from either a stroke, heart attack, or multiple organ failure as your kidneys and liver give up.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or, you can swap your medications out for medical marijuana and see what that does.'  I swapped out my meds for medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Never had it before.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Was so paranoid about using it I almost considered that sudden death from a stroke would be better.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Did it anyway.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Took care of my pain better than any medication.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's four years now, my blood pressure is spot on, my kidney and liver function are fine, my pain is managed, and I'm still able to work.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do I think pot is a cure all?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No, but there are medically proven extremely beneficial uses to it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not just my condition is well treated by it, but it stops muscle spasms in people who have frequent diaphragm issues, and stops/greatly reduces seizures in children with severe seizure conditions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just look up Charlotte's Web and how that came to be a thing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anecdotally, I had a slipped disc once and was prescribed a fairly expensive 'neuropathic' pain killer: gabapentin.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I didn't work very well and I couldn't sleep for a couple weeks because of the pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One day, in desperation, I went to a dispensary and got some CBD to try on the advice of a friend.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's possible there was a placebo effect happening, but the pain was substantially reduced and I was able to sleep much better.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What struck me about the experience wasn't that it worked, so much as how cheap it was - like 1/20 the cost per dose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe that's partially to do with the fact that the cannabis at the time was not regulated - no expensive trials and FDA approvals to deal with - not the drug makers fault.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think the pain-reduction, and sleep aid aspects of cannabis are widely disputed, though I could be wrong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That said, 'snake oil' has historically been a money-making scheme - not necessarily a way to get high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm generally pro-business, but I think it's fair to say that Pharmaceutical companies have, \*at times\*, been involved in manipulating or influencing research about the effectiveness of their own drugs, down-playing side-effects, or trashing the effectiveness of cheaper competing alternatives.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And they spend  HUGE money on Marketing and PR to push these drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So, I agree with the idea that cannabis is being 'over-hyped', but I think you may be slightly under-recognizing the potential medical value and not taking into consideration that this value may be under-researched given the economics.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since nobody has a patent on cannabis, my hunch is that pot propaganda stands out because it is un-sophisticated and unregulated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whereas, efforts to promote things like Opioids, for example, are heavily-funded and take place behind the scenes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which one of these things is more like snake oil is debatable in my view.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Up to 70%, depending on location.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is heavily dependant on what part of the state you're in.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even though Marijuana is legal state wide, there are plenty of cities and counties slapping restrictions on the sale of it already in terms of steeper than normal taxes  This obstructionism may subdue the market place for the first few years, because even though you are allowed to open up shop already, the city you live in can still tell you where you can and cannot.

medical marijuana				This means that they can place shops in locations with low/no foot traffic to deter people from selling.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				It's still against the Federal law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				On the off chance you get stopped by someone at the Federal level and they have a soft spot for someone with a medical need, it might be your get out of jail free card.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah, I agree on that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Carrying a medical card for your valid medical condition is likely to place you in a much more favorable position than recreational users.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How about a delta then?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Isn't that a serious benefit you'd be missing out on if you decided to not get a medical card?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It will depend if you can get the exact same strains from recreational as you can with medicinal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Strains high in CBD, for example, might not be available recreationally (at least at first).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yep.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yep.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They got THC limit on marijuana edibles and tinctures, from what I last read.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was thinking the same thing, quite frankly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But for me, the high taxation rate was enough to knock some sense into me and helped me made the transition to be a medical marijuana user.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes bro, you missing lots of benefits if you not renew you medical card in 2018.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like save taxes and legal protections.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It seems like if you wanted it to be taken more seriously we would have to stop giving strains very non-medical names.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would take make doctor far more seriously if he prescribed me medical marijuana and suggested that an indica would be the best for my problem than if he wrote me a prescription for Alaskan Thunderfuck  or Sour diesel	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				This.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have nothing against the movement, and indeed, partake myself occasionally- but the strain names are juvenile, at best.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It can't be helping the perception of the legalize/medicinal movement by outsiders.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Regardless of efficacy, it's a professionalism thing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"Alaskan Thunderfuck" is a magnificent name, but it doesn't really suggest surcease of pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since the strain (sativa/indica) is what really matters in terms of effect (pain relief vs focus/appetite), perhaps make that more visible in the name?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A cannabis beginner is unlikely to know that kush's are generally indicas, or whatever (are they? I'm guessing).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				More curative sounding names, maybe?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Panacea?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Re-leaf?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Get some of the more literate stoners on this, or don't, whatever, man.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Technically they're all sativa.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"Indica" is a misnomer used by the stoner culture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not all are sativa.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Cannabis sativa ssp.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				indica  >Cannabis sativa ssp.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				sativa  >Cannabis ruderalis  Just because it's a subspecies doesn't make it a misnomer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually, what you've just quoted is the misnomer I was talking about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Really, you've got: cannabis sativa sativa, cannabis sativa sativa forma indica, and cannabibs sativa ruderalis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Indica is actually poorly defined and mostly used as an "I know it when I see it" botanical classification.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Indica is being more specific than just sativa.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is a difference.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Huh.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then is it possible to organize strains by effect?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Mental high vs "body" high, or whatever.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Both types of names exist in current strains.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The silly or fun names, and the curative sounding ones.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just like there are comedic movies and dramatic movies.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Both are okay and are enjoyed by many.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Neither are juvenile though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's a judgment you are placing on the culture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How can you say "Alaskan Thunderfuck" isn't juvenile?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a name someone came up with when they were stoned out of their mind and thought it sounded hilarious.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's not professional in any sense of the word.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				professional is not the opposite of juvenile.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Adult is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Saying something isn't professional as a way to refute someone saying it isn't juvenile is a pointless statement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The name is not juvenile.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is a name that belongs to a unique culture (of adults btw) in which ridiculous and hilarious names are commonplace.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are using juvenile in a derogatory fashion because you don't think the name is funny.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				By using juvenile in that way you also seem to be trying to paint those who find it funny as immature or childish.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think you are being quite judgmental.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The hell you say, Alaskan Thunderfuck is a hilarious name!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This exchange was the first time I've heard of it, and I laughed out loud sober.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And yet, it is silly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would feel awkward (and likely, paranoid) trying to explain to a square that I'm currently blazed on Thunderfuck.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think you're being a little defensive, and maybe taking this a bit personally (not my intent).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ride some electric thunderfuck and read the rest of this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The problem isn't that *I believe* the names are inherently juvenile, but that they can be *perceived* as juvenile.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you're not part of the group, you won't get the joke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is fine if it's your dad or something, but what if it's your Congresscritter?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They tend to be older, and more likely to make value judgements.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Until they legalize, we may want to *not* alienate them?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The problem is, you don't need to convince your fellow stoners it's not a silly name.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I *know* it's a silly name, *and that's fine*, for me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We need to convince non-stoners that we're not *just* stoners thinking up goofy names.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That, or wait for the older generations to start dying.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Public perception is often judgmental.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since we can't fix that until we legalize-- we may want to button down the nomenclature until enough old people kick it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just my two cents, I'm sorry you took offense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> If you're not part of the group, you won't get the joke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is only tangentially related, but I think that this is at the heart of why people are adverse to subcultures in general, and also, coincidentally, why I can't date stoner chicks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When they start talking about Alaskan Thunderfuck or whatever strain, my mind glosses over and I realize that this is how non-D&D players must feel when I start nerding out over a D&D game with a D&D friend in front of them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There was a joke about this that went something like:  "So I just hit level 80 on my Warrior, and that means running through the Cataclysm content, but I'm really thinking I might gear him up a bit by running heroic Lich King dungeons, if I can find any groups for that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then again, the starting Cataclysm gear is probably an upgrade, knowing how these things go.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm also considering respeccing into arms from Fury because it's better but really I like dual wielding greatswords and that glazed look on your face is exactly how I feel when people talk about football"  Which is all to say: inside jokes are for when you're around people who are on, well, the inside of that joke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It only serves to alienate outsiders and create barriers to understanding and entry, and inevitably a subculture going mainstream has to lose some bit of its inside lingo as it gets mainstreamed, particularly when you start dealing with medicine which has some pretty standardized naming conventions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Public perception is often judgmental. Since we can't fix that until we legalize-- we may want to button down the nomenclature until enough old people kick it. Just my two cents, I'm sorry you took offense.  I just don't think changing the names of strains is going to make any difference on the legalization front. Most of the government-types you talk about are so far removed from marijuana culture that they've probably never even heard of Alaskan Thunderfuck or Big Daddy Purple.  The naming of strains is one of my favorite parts of marijuana culture. They are descriptive and unique. And, in my opinion of course, we should not have to change that aspect of the culture a bit to achieve legalization.   And believe me, I'm not offended in the slightest. Just expressing my views =)	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				"Medical Marijuana" is just the backdoor being used to work towards a post-prohibition recreational use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is the medical community lending a legitimacy to a social movement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We don't want it to be "Taken Seriously", and pushed to just a different drug schedule.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We want it descheduled completely and treated like alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Being "Taken Seriously" as a prescription drug, as you seem to want it to be would actually harm that goal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana being federally rescheduled as a prescription drug is at odds with the real goals if the pot movement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not necessarily, I don't see any reason why the cannabis movement should aim for both the recognition that is both a recreationally safe drug, and an effective treatment for certain medical ailments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The two goals can exist with mutual exclusivity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis has many documented benefits for medical purposes, just because healthy people can enjoy it recreationally doesn't mean the genuine medical reasons for its use are invalid.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Being both a prescription drug and a freely available substance are mutually exclusive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ibuprofen seems to manage both just fine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can get it from a pharmacist, with a prescription, covered by insurance, or I can buy it myself pretty much everywhere with minimal restrictions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors recommend good diet and exercise.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They aren't prescribed but still have medical benefits.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Furthermore the exercise has a minimum and a maximum but is left unspecified.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've also had doctors tell me to take ibuprofen or aspirin without recommending a dosage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've never seen a doctor writing a prescription for "walking".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They sure recommend it, but "walking" isn't a prescription drug, much like ibuprofen.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"Prescription drugs" implies a controlled substance one can only access with a prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As such, it's incompatible with the idea of a freely available substance one can literally grow himself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes but as you said, the medical benefits of walking aren't lost just because doctors don't write prescriptions for it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The medical benefits don't have to be overlooked just because something isn't a controlled substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From a doctor's point of view, the two classes aren't mutually exclusive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Oh, I see.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not arguing against he medical uses of cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know they're not mutually exclusive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean to say that cannabis doesn't *need* to be a prescription drug (controlled) in order to be medically effective.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since when?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can go online and buy painkillers, antibiotics, statins, insulin, whatever you like.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Each of them can, and are, prescribed for various things but can also be bought.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't see why marijuana would be any different.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With further research and breeding it'll be easy to make strains with X or Y, which are proven to be more effective at combating A or B.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You could have both regular weed as a freely available substance, and specialised strains for specific medical uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes they are mutually exclusive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But there are hundreds of medecines that are freely available over the counter at pharmacys and perscribed by doctors.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I take Pantaprazole, due to frequent and continuing issues with heartburn.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was presribed it by my Doctor under the brand name "Protium", I can also purchase the exact same medicine over the counter called "Pantoloc".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Both contain the same amount of Pantaprazole, both treat my issues with the same degree of success.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just because something is presribed doesn't necessarily mean that one should need a perscription to obtain it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've been prescribed motrin and prilosec before...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, but that doesn't make Motrin a prescription drug in the same way that Vicodin is a prescription drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm pretty sure my doctor told me many times to drink more water, that doesn't make water a controlled substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some over the counter drugs can be prescribed, it doesn't make them prescription drugs in the same way most people define *prescription drugs*.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pretending that you are interested in its medical use while actually just wanting free recreational use hardly adds legitimacy to your movement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If treating medical marijuana like a legitimate, standardized medicine is hurting your real goal, then you should not be promoting medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The problem I see with that is the fact that there are some legitimate medical uses that have NOTHING to do with recreational use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are several strains that have virtually none of the compounds that get you high, but are extremely effective at reducing anxiety, treating seizure disorders, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It seems ridiculous to punish patients who could actually benefit from the medicinal properties of marijuana by refusing to decouple recreational use from legitimate medical uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The medical community doesn't care about legalizing pot; it was just a really poorly written law with a huge loophole.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I actually think California has hurt the medical marijuana movement nationwide since other states look at the West Coast and think to themselves "I'm ok with marijuana as medicine, but over there it's just legal drug dealing and that's not ok."	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If medical marijuana wants to be taken seriously in California then we need to stop giving out recommendations to anyone who can go to one of those doctors who do nothing but rubber stamp medical marijuana recommendations and pay $60 or so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just open up a local paper (like SF Guardian or East Bay Express) and you'll see doctors offering very cheap services.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There was even a guy who used to not charge if you didn't get a recommendation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Almost no one gets turned away from these doctors.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Frankly, I don't get how they still have their licenses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My friend got his recommendation from a woman who wore a green lab coat with pot leaf earrings.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's someone who opened up an office inside of the Haight-Ashbury Amoeba Records.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That isn't how legitimate medical professionals do business.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The current system is a regulatory joke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm sure you've noticed that there are a lot of recreational users at every club.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The one I frequent had a 4-20 sale.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Kinda weird since I don't see CVS having a National Opiate Day sale where OxyContin was half off.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				edit: tl;dr: if medical marijuana wants to be taken seriously, then it needs to be treated like a real Schedule II drug, not with a wink and a nod.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				edit2: Another reason why medical marijuana should not be taken seriously: in California, prescription medicines are not allowed to be taxed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				http://www.taxes.ca.gov/Sales_and_Use_Tax/WhatsTaxable.shtml  However, we tax MMJ.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because we all know it's a joke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We should just legalize recreational use and cut the bullshit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is completely besides the point of this CMV.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But in a way it's why this CMV exists.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah cannabis can be great for pain and appetite or whatever but I would guess the majority is recreational (I don't live in the states so I don't know) and that's what the names are targeting.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not really.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				OP's saying that medical marijuana needs to change if it wants to be taken more seriously, but the issue is that it doesn't.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a legal workaround for people to get marijuana legally - that's it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why the cards are given out willy-nilly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why the dispensaries are the way they are, and the names of the strains the way that they are.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's legal hand-waiving to get around the illegality of it, and it's usually enough for police and the federal court system to look away.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's playing the game until marijuana actually gets legalized, and these "medical dispensaries" can just open up their doors to anyone of legal age.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> It's a legal workaround for people to get marijuana legally  Well I can't take that seriously then.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical Marijuana and Marijuana Legalization should be two separate things.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not really.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical Marijuana is there to ease the public's misconceptions about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It was released medicinally, and the world didn't burn down.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not only that, but people realized that there are legitimate uses for it, cause despite the way it's being run it still has helped a good number of people who actually need it medically.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All this has compounded over time to have a huge political shift where legalizing it has become more an issue of when, rather than if.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No they shouldn't be separate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If marijuana is legalized for recreational purposes, then its medical distribution will be strictly that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At the moment both people that need it as medicine and want it for recreation are left only with the option to obtain it medically.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why it isn't rigorous, but that shouldn't stop you from taking seriously its medical use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It should leave you wondering why they don't go for straight legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Edit: Expanding on it, what I mean is recreational use and medical use should be separate, but the only reason they are mixed at the moment is it isn't fully legal, so you can't separate medical use from legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The point of the first is to prove that the second is harmless.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They're very much the same thing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Having medicinal purpose does not in and of itself prove that something isn't harmful though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				True, but plenty of other studies prove that marijuana isn't harmful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well yeah, I know that, simply pointing out that you can't prove that something is safe by simply noting that it has medicinal purposes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No, the point of medical is that marijuana has medical benefits for some people and they should be allowed to use it for that purpose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We have medical Oxycontin, but that doesn't mean it's harmless.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical use and harmless are totally different things.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Saying they're the same just trivializes the actual medical needs that people use marijuana for.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				It should when taken as medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> My point is that marijuana is not that complicated for a drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is actually somewhat complicated, there are over 400 known substances and at least 84 different cannabinoids(all of which may have subtlety different neurological effects).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> If someone needs it for insomnia and marijuana helps them then so be it, the strain is up to the person to decide since everyone has their own preference.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which strains are prescribed for different diseases should be determined by a combination of empirical research and doctor/patient interaction.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> We're not talking about a synthetic drug here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whether something is synthetic or natural has absolutely no bearing on the potential harm it may cause.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you want to smoke marijuana simply because you find it fun, then more power to you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, if marijuana is used in a medical setting then it should be administered based on empirical evidence (to determine what strains/concentrations are best for which diseases and not maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects) and what reduces potential harm(like addiction and negative side effects).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I visited CA from the UK last year and at Venice beach I got offered my pot 'licence' multiple times.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Found it pretty hilarious how easy it was.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah I'm not quite sure how it came to be that way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My friend recently got his, all he had to do was walk in and claim he had insomnia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hell you could walk in with a stubbed toe and I guarantee you they won't turn you down.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The law is really poorly written.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At first, the legislation was trying to restrict who could get medical marijuana and for what.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So they were listing specific conditions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But people were complaining since they were missing out on certain uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So eventually we got to the point where medical marijuana could be prescribed as long as the doctor thought that it reduced pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The LA Times got a women a recommendation for "high heel pain."  As in, her feet hurt when she wore heels.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The only person who got rejected in that article was someone underaged.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe because California understands that prohibition is stupid?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This seems similar to the problem people have with coffee;  it's viewed as an illegitimate way to enhance wakefulness because it is not prescribed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A system of licensing could fix this,  or we would need to admit that not every substance that has medical effects is a medicine,  and let people drink coffee wherever and whenever they want - chaos.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Who views coffee that way?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just me, as far as I can tell.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The big difference here is that no one thinks of coffee as a medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No - but they could.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What is the between coffee and caffeine pills?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What's the difference between caffeine pills and aspirin or any OTC drug?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What's the difference between caffeinated drinks and pot brownies?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a spectrum, with no reason to think pot should be more severe than caffeine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's a problem with coffee..?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since when.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There isn't.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is the point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It has medical effects,  but it should not be regulated like a medicine...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				somewhat similar to another substance with medical benefits that shouldn't be regulated the way it is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Having a prescribed dosage and treatment method for medical marijuana has relatively little bearing on its legality of use outside of the medical field.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When I go to the doctor and prescribes me some over the counter medicine, he doesn't just say "Here take all these pills in whatever timeframe/quantity you want." No, he says take x-amount of milligrams every x-hours.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana could be exactly like Tylenol or cough syrup.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can buy it no problem in any store, but when its prescribed your doctor still provides precise instructions for use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I also don't think its unreasonable that to expect that any kind of medication that I am prescribed be prepared under controlled conditions, have standards of purity, and have exact guidelines for use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All things that I have either not seen at all with medical marijuana or at the very least not seen approaching the level of standardization/quality control you see with other medicines.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a plant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You'll see that kind of standardization with chemically extracted THC, but for pot you smoke, standardized doses are not reasonable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>  standardized doses are not reasonable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In that same vein, I think that standardized doses at this point would actually *reduce* the credibility of marijuana as a viable, "legitimate" medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We have (virtually) zero legitimate testing on the subject beyond most doctors agreeing that it's basically harmless in most cases.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Beyond that, we have no research on drug interactions, potentially serious (albeit rare) side effects, or weight/gender/etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				dosing levels.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At this point, doctors can say "we know it's relatively safe, so take this card and use *as needed*, and look out for these side effects, avoid driving, etc." But anything more specific than that would be a shot in the dark, based mostly on generations of debatable stoner dogma about how much and what type.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No other medication gets that kind of treatment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's already in a precarious position, but if we force physicians to go further than the research allows, it will actually reduce credibility and there will continue to be no standardization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was pointing out that it should not be medicalized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's like coffee - yes,  it had medical effects,  but it's a drink,  not a medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pot is similar - treat it as a consumable goods,  not a medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What other prescribed drugs do you have to smoke?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The whole "medical marijuana" thing is a sham.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You don't need to smoke pot either - you can make it into foods as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's very similar to what pharmacists can do for children's medication.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But the point is that it has medical effects,  not that it must be treated as a prescribed medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We make this distinction with caffeine and aspirin.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's because you don't, or rather are not supposed to, smoke marijuana prescribed for medicinal purposes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is either eaten in the form of an edible or vaporized	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually, it's fairly common for certain drugs to be prescribed for use "as needed" (my cough syrup comes with this dose), with a recommended amount (2T) and frequency (every 4-6 hours).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's just that with certain drugs, there isn't a "this will be harmful after X uses per day" threshold.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My asthma inhaler doesn't come with any instructions - just as needed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I found out it wasn't working originally when I ran out in a couple of days and the doctor said "How often are you taking it?" and was surprised and appalled by the "Every 20 minutes, since it doesn't seem to be doing much".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Right, but there is a standardized percentage of medicine within that inhaler and scientific evidence that it is the active ingredients are good for treating your disorder.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm saying we should do the same thing for marijuana, use marijuana with controlled levels of THC and CBD because different percentages are better at treating different disorders.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Properly regulated medical marijuana would be like this:  I would get a prescription for "Bonehead's Dank Junk" with 20% THC levels to treat my glaucoma(as opposed to that other strain with lower levels of THC and higher CBD that wouldn't treat my glaucoma as well).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He recommends I use 10 milligrams every 4 hours to maximize therapeutic effects and minimize unwanted side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But, Since the drug is relatively safe, my doctor would tell me that I could increase or decrease the amount I use in each sitting based on my experience.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> But if you use 'too much' marijuana, you'll just fall asleep.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or suffer nausea, panic attacks, paranoia, mild hallucinations etc...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Too much weed doesn't just make you go to sleep, it can be pretty fucking unpleasant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not going to kill you, but it's far from ideal for people who actually use cannabis medicinally/therapeutically and could be very detrimental to their wellbeing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As are sixteen coffees.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Coffee isn't often used in a medical setting, if it were, dosage would likely be controlled and my comment was more to correct their point that; "if you use 'too much' marijuana, you'll just fall asleep.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or eat too many Oreos", which is patently false.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or people are able to use common sense in dealing with a marginally addictive substance which could very well be taken as needs dictate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While I agree that too much marijuana (or anything) can be harmful, I don't think that alone warrants higher regulations.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Or people are able to use common sense in dealing with a marginally addictive substance which could very well be taken as needs dictate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I wasn't trying to argue otherwise.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have given no opinion on the overall CMV, just correcting what I saw as a factual error.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have to overshoot by a long way for most of this however.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think people who are genuinely using it therapeutically are not likely to consume that much.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, but it can certainly happen and it's not like it takes a heroic amount to make you feel shitty if you're not a heavy smoker.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Or suffer nausea, panic attacks, paranoia, mild hallucinations etc...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Too much weed doesn't just make you go to sleep, it can be pretty fucking unpleasant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That can also happen after 3 tokes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People are different, which makes standardising that sort of thing difficult.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>mild hallucinations  Source?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Erm.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis is pretty widely accepted as a hallucinogenic drug, it very commonly causes mild auditory and visual hallucinations, even at relatively small doses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not claiming anything controversial here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not too sure how (nor motivated) to go about finding a scholarly source, but if you look for them you will find them and if wikipedia's good enough for you, [here you go](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis) and I'm sure [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=1&S2=-3&C1=-1&Str=) will have plenty for you, particularly if you look at experiences with high doses of cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I'm being prescribed potentially addicting drugs that I wouldn't normally use, I want to know that my doctor is setting me up with a treatment plan that minimizes those risks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I'm being prescribed Oxy for post-operative pain my doctor doesn't just let me pick whether or not I want 100, 200, or 250 milligram pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm going to get an exact dose and precise instructions on how to take those pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With medical marijuana, its more like "here's your card and now go pick whatever you want." (please correct me if I'm wrong).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I understand that marijuana isn't as potentially life threatening as prescription strength opioids, but both drugs carry very real addiction risks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Every other drug we use in medical settings has been tested and is thoroughly regulated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I see no reason why marijuana, when used in medical setting, should get a free pass on all that regulation(and I mean more stringent testing and regulation than the batch testing you mentioned).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Many substances carry addiction risks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is much lower on the scale of risk than something like Oxycontin, not to mention the toxicity of the drug is almost non-existent for practical purposes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is treated in a similar manner as OTC pain relievers like Ibuprofen or Asprin.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because the onset of the effects is so rapid, it is left up to the user to determine how much is required.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, research and data on the effects of various doses is very sparse, so a doctor is simply unable at this point to prescribe a specific dose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Again, with the toxicity being so low this is not a problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Many substances carry addiction risks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And if they are being prescribed in a medical setting then they should be closely regulated as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Marijuana is treated in a similar manner as OTC pain relievers like Ibuprofen or Asprin.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because the onset of the effects is so rapid, it is left up to the user to determine how much is required.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No, with aspirin, cough syrup, or acetaminophen I can get a prescription to take xxx-miligrams of aspirin/acetaminophen/cough syrup every xxx-hours.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With medical marijuana I get a card and I go pick between a bunch of different strains and potencies.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then I can go home and smoke as little or as much as I want.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If they were similar then I would get a prescription for "Bonehead's Dank Junk" with 20% THC levels to treat my glaucoma(as opposed to that other strain with lower levels of THC and higher CBD that wouldn't treat my glaucoma as well).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since the drug is relatively safe, my doctor would tell me that I could increase or decrease the amount I use in each sitting based on my experience.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Also, research and data on the effects of various doses is very sparse, so a doctor is simply unable at this point to prescribe a specific dose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, and I think more research should be done to determine what strains are most effective at treating different disorders.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, make marijuana legal for everyday use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But if it's going to be used in a medical setting then it should be regulated and studied the same way that every other drug is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's because Aspirin (acetominophen), Ibuprofin, and cough syrup can all kill you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Taking to much aspirin can damage your liver, especially if you combine it with drinking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ibuprofin in high amounts hurts your kidneys.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana in high amounts doesn't kill you or cause organ damage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Response to the dosage of Marijuana is extremely variable as well, both genetically person to person, as well as due to tolerance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This make it almost impossible to come up with an accurate dosage due to weight.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now that said, there are some cases that do have a specific dosage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Such as the dosage for kids who have chronic seizures.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you smoke marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are different levels of tolerance between people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One person could need one bong hit while another needs a solid 30 minutes of smoking joints	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So what?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's different levels of tolerance when people are prescribed opioids as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And sometimes people bounce between several diferent opioids before they find one that works for them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What I'm saying is there should be a more a scientific approach to this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I want to be able to go to my doctor and get a prescription for "Bonehead's Dank Junk with 20% THC because we have scientific proof that that is the best strain to treat my glaucoma(as opposed to that other strain with less THC and more CBD that won't treat my disorder as well).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then, because marijuana is a relatively safe drug, my doctor tells me I can increase or decrease how much I use in every sitting.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just like how if I get a prescription for 250 milligrams of ibuprofen my doctor will say "Take 250 milligrams every 4 hours.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you don't notice any change you can take 500 milligrams every 4 hours."	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If marijuana is legal *for medical purposes* then it most definitely should be regulated as a medical substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Otherwise there is zero point in calling it a medical substance when we all know it is a bunch of teenagers who complain about pain to get a pot card mixed in with a few people who legitimately use it for medical purposes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why many advocates are pushing for legal recreational use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because the substance has medical benefits and benefits that are more recreational.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it does both and does not cause harm, why not legalize it for both?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Teenagers?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You do realize that the large majority of marijuana users are not teenagers and that in the two states where it's been legalized use among teenagers has dropped pretty significantly, right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The two states where recreational use has been legalized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Important distinction in my opinion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are other states where medical marijuana is legal but recreational use is not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As to fewer teenagers using them, that is easy to explain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You and I were both teenagers once, we know what it is like.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone tells you not to do something then you want to do it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Since the law is telling you not to smoke weed, some people are going to want to smoke it for no other reason than fighting authority.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now that it is legal you have removed that incentive from people, hence teenager use is dropping.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He's being sarcastic in order to emphasize his point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're saying in the background that you used ritalin and lexapro and neither were effective but that the dosing recommendations were helpful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How can you claim the dosing recommendations were effective if the drugs didn't work?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				On the other hand, you've found through your own experimentation how much and what kind of marijuana works for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What I'm wondering is why you think that the method that didn't work for you is better than the method that did work?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And yeah, of course, there is the question of legitimacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But isn't "legitimacy" kind of pointless?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean, if it is legal, and it works, who cares what "squares" think about it?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The point of medication isn't to gain the approval of the populace (most of which, if I'm correct, thinks smoking pot is aok both for medicine and for fun).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So I have two question for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why do you think what worked is wrong while what didn't work is right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And why does it matter if something is considered "legitimate," when it is already available in your state?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The process for finding the correct dosage for Ritalin was still a hell of a lot more effective than trying to find it for Marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was on Ritalin for about 2 years in highschool, and while it was effective in helping my grades its long-term effect was less useful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But it took 2 months to find what worked with a psychiatrist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When i was trying to find what worked with MM, it took me almost 2 years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And legitimacy matters to me because I don't want to get fired when a boss of mine doesn't believe in Medical Marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Legitimacy means that this method of treatment is accepted by the government and my employers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				MM as treatment may be effective for me, but the lack of regulated prescription made it very difficult to find the best dosage for it to be most effective.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While Lexapro didn't work for me, I knew within a month because my psychiatrist knew what to look for.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As far a dosage goes, I think the primary problem is that doctors don't know how much and what strain should be prescribed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It differs greatly from person to person, and there are no real studies in this regard.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors would necessarily be guessing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think from the perspective of a health care professional, they're likely thinking that anyone who is prescribed marijuana will try different dosages and types until they find one that works.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think the problem is we're skipping a step.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Rather than suggest doctors prescribe amounts and types, perhaps we should advocate large scale serious studies, (which could perhaps be open sourced quickly and easily).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As far as legitimacy-as long as it is legal in your state, the government accepts the treatment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If an employer would fire you for taking a medically prescribed treatment, then you should sue your employer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This isn't the best case scenario, but it isn't likely that a simple dosage recommendation with each prescription would change the mind of an employer who would fire an employee for using his prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a solution for this problem, it would probably be better to make it illegal for employers to drug test for marijuana or discriminate against those who use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That way you don't need to worry about who thinks it is legitimate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In short, we don't know the correct dosage per person, so why not let them experiment and find out?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And, anyone who would discriminate against someone for treating themselves with a certain drug would not be swayed by a dosage recommendation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The better path to follow would be collecting more data on users and what works, which is necessary before dosing with any authority; and making it so it doesn't matter what employers think by making discrimination based upon usage illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Thats the best I've heard it put.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				∆ to you, sir.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				EDIT: Specifically, The call for more studies instead of just jumping to more stringent practices in prescription.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Or we could conduct double blind placebo controlled studies on the interactions between various disorders and different marijuana strains, like what we do for all other drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This method would remove the need for the patient to experiment and provide with solid information about which strains are best for treating diferent disorders(instead of letting pick what they smoke based on incorrect anecdotal evidence).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The issue here would be with replication.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The medicinal content of the strains is fairly variable, but the bigger source of variation within a single strain is likely going to be from growing conditions, soil conditions, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can conduct the study, but it's going to be very expensive, very large, and very complicated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's absolutely what we should do, but until we actually do that then the current system of dispensaries/clinics is definitely the more sensible option.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also I'm not sure how happy patients would be with prescriptions and the increase in prices/need for health insurance they would inevitably see.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It could weed out the potheads that don't actually need it for medicinal purposes but would make life even worse for those who do but have trouble affording it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As someone who only casually smoked every now and then when I was younger, I just have to ask: Does pot really work that way?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is there really that much difference between different strains that they could be prescribed that way?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From my experience, very much yes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When I was dialing in on how medicating worked, I had a problem in determining how much I should smoke and when in the day for the best effect.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This was because I was switching strains every month because I didn't have a stable dealer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The big split is between Indica and Sativa, the first better for pain, the second for focus and appetite.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And are those the effects for you, or are those fairly Universal?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If 10 people all take similar doses of the same strain, will all 10 people have substantially the same effects, or is it different from person to person?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's going to be different.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's ridiculous to say that certain strains will consistently produce certain universal effects, especially across different harvests.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's too subjective.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Exactly this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think that's the main problem with this view, people just react too differently.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In general, the difference is indica strains have higher CBD and sativa strains have higher THC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				they will feel different to anyone who compares the two.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unless I'm mistaken it is impossible to overdose on marijuana and it is not chemically addictive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no logical reason for a doctor to say anything other than use as needed in this regard.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With opiate based pain meds you have both the potential for addiction and the potential to do serious harm if taken in large quantities.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because of this there is no logical reason for it to be a prescription only medication.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The only reason it is prescription only is because it was previously completely prohibited.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prescription medication gets tested before it is approved.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is expansive and usually take years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How can a doctor know which strain is best for your condition without the testing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is 'medical' marijuana because of the hype against weed for many years and illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Once it becomes legal, I imagine we will stop using the term.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are different kinds of medical treatments, such as between medical prescriptions (e.g. vicodin, penicillin) and regimental prescriptions (e.g. exercise, physical therapy).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One would see value in limiting a person’s access and usage of a substance that has well understood benefits and potential risks by the medical establishment, and one would see value in allowing one to pursue a subjectively appropriate amount of a recommended regiment such as pursuing a marathon while far less physical activity would be satisfactory for improving heart health (amongst other things) if the patient wished to do so because there are (virtually) no physical drawbacks to performing a marathon.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, if a treatment was part of the latter and the former category one would expect to also mix the interpretations of its appropriate usage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana serves as both a medicine (e.g.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[through reducing blood pressure]( http://medicalmarijuana.com/medical-marijuana-treatments/Hypertension-High-Blood-Pressure-)) and as a regiment (e.g. through a subjectively beneficial physical activity).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As such, it should be viewed as appropriate if one uses marijuana in the amounts that one feels is subjectively appropriate with the method(s) that they choose and should only be used in a medical capacity through permission by a medical professional.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While there are indeed those who use marijuana medically without a prescription and recreationally, there are examples of substances which serve medical functions (e.g. alcohol) but are used recreationally, and if those substances are not abused to the point of causing interference in one’s life, then there typically isn’t a social stigma attached to its usage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I am not sure how it is State-side but in Canada, the strain and strength is specified on the prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That being said, the problem with the various strains is actually due to Government restriction.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Until recently, obtaining approval for research into cannabis and it's various strains was very hard.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So, what did researchers do?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They asked "self-prescribers" for information.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is, people who took marijuana for various medical symptoms on their own, basically illegally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because that was the only way to obtain information on use of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now that the stigma associated with the use of marijuana is fading away - and the government restrictions are more likely to go away - we may actually see proper research done on various strains, strengths, etc of marijuana and their effects on various symptoms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe in 10 years, we can switch away from names such as purple haze and call them "anti-seizure", "pain-killers", "anti-GI" etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But until proper research is possible - not going to happen.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The testing required for individual strains, and more importantly the individual plants, is ridiculous, so lets toss that notion of regular specific dosages right out.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also you as a smoker should be well aware to the tolerance that builds up after a couple days.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				so self dosing has been, and will be for the foreseeable future will remain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There isn't much research into strain swapping to combat tolerance afaik.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then there's the method of intake.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Joints,blunts, pipes, bongs, vapes, all do the same thing effectively, but there's no way for the ada/fda to regulate how much you smoke, by what method, and how often.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How do you feel about extracts?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Extracts are easily dosed, and potency is much easier to track, but the medicinal effects are entirely overshadowed by the nearly-narcotic effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I believe that medical marijuana is a gateway law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It doesn't matter how much of what is prescribed, the point is to prove that it's not harmful and society won't collapse because some people are getting high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Having said that, here's why I don't think it matters how much of what kind of weed you are prescribed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The chemicals that have actual medicinal benefits are common to all species and breeds of the plant, and it is impossible to overdose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Given those two qualities, why bother regulating and specifying intake?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The reason that even pills as harmless as ibuprofen are limited is because they can kill you if you take too much.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Take too much tylenol, and you die.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Take too much vicodin, and you die.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Take too much  morphine, and you die.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Take too much weed, well...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in onemarijuana cigarette.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				-- *[Source](http://www.ccguide.org/young88.php)*	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The idea that specific strains produce specific results is more salesmanship than proven science, and is no basis for actual treatment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you want to say actual TCH counts should be included in prescription, then you add expensive testing into the equation and making sourcing of the medication a much more expensive process, especially since there's no possibility of overdose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In the end this might not be great for the patient either as reaction to Marijuana seems to be based on a lot of X factors that might just be better, and cheaper for patients to figure out themselves.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sorry, but you're a bit off.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				I don't think anyone is going to care about any of that as soon as the money starts rolling in.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The acceptance of medical marijuana is going to stem from the ability of lobbyists to sell it to politicians.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prescription medication uses set doses because most of the drugs are powerful and dangerous if misused.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				if it was possible pharmaceutical companies would be sellling you as much as they possibly could and encouraging you to use them recrationally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Only because of the threat of law suits is the dosage of medication regulated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It kind of already happens in relation to high cannabinoid / low THC strains in treating illnesses that have seizures (like epilepsy).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				you are on the right track, but the real problem is that marijuana is not technically "medical".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				if you want to treat it as a drug, then it should go through the FDA's New Drug Approval process.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				maybe it helps stuff like glaucoma and such, idk because there really aren't good, scientifically controlled studies on it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				it needs to be treated like every other pharmaceutical drug, and be approved in the same way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				i should not just be the decision of a group of idiot politicians who vote for it to be considered a "drug" because there is public support for it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Politicians need to have guts and approve it for recreational use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				and then let the FDA decide if it is approved for medical use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				that's how medicine and science works.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				stick with it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Taken seriously by whom?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors and patients are taking it seriously, who else matters in this scenario?	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Couldn't have put it better myself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I repectfully disagree.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just because they aren't in favor of it, does not mean that they take it seriously.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I live in florida where Charlotte's web was just legalized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medicinal use is on the nov ballot in fl.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Much of the public is uneducated about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's really hard to undo decades of "don't do drugs and stay in school."  The public that I deal with feels that the needs of a few sick people are less than an inebriated and irresponsible society that is inevitable is canabis is legalized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(Their view, not mine).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Here in florida, local municipalities are passing "pill mill" ordinances, designed to curb prescription drug abuse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medicinal canabis is something the public here takes very seriously, and it's about an even split in favor and against.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				So should Cannabis be grouped in with Asparin even though it is much more potent?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ah- I think I need to clarify, sorry.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My point was that though Aspirin is definitely more dangerous in large doses, Cannabis will have a greater effect on you in smaller doses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While it may not be in any way more dangerous, it is certainly more impairing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Would we want to group something as potentially impairing as Cannabis with something like Aspirin?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The idea that prescriptions need to be for specific amount is wrong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For many psychological disorders the psychiatrist orders the patient to take the drugs "as needed."  They may put a recommended dose down but it is really just a suggestion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The patient is the in charge of figuring out when they need the drug and how much to take.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now this obviously dependent on the patient being able to handle self dosing, but it is not that hard.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Source: I have ADHD and this is how my psychiatrist manages my medication for me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have been prescribed as-needed medication for panic attacks and migraines.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The difference is that on the bottle there are specific instructions as to how they should be administered.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You aren't just given a few different strains and told to make it work, you are given 30 ER Ritalin at 10mg and told to take one as needed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are loads of non prescription medications.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is quite a bit safer than most of them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It really should be over the counter (in which case trying to strictly regulate dosage and strain is moot).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Another problem is that the concept of a "strain" isn't very scientific.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is more like the varietals of apples than it is like the different formulations of a medication.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All cannabis that can be smoked belongs to the subspecies C.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sativa Sativa.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The differences in effects are known purely through anecdote and culture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				**There is no medical research into the different strains and no good definition for any given strain**.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prescribing a specific strain would be medically inexcusable with current research.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As for specific dosing, this isn't possible with the plant form of cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These problems are solved easily by concentrates (which can be dosed carefully and made with a consistent makeup), but people see them and go "oh my god it's drugs!"	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are actually lots of foundations and labs who are currently researching the effects of different strains and different THC/CBD ratios.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				http://www.greenleaflab.org/  While there are many medications that are non-prescription, not many have the same potency and effect as MM.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The type of painkillers you'd need to help in some cases of Fibromyalgia are prescribed where the same cases may often be treated with Medical Marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In terms of specific dosing, I agree that concentrates might be the better option, but that still means that they should be prescribed by a doctor in specific dosages.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The framing of this question is inaccurate: card holders in California do not receive a prescription; they receive a recommendation from a physician.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This recommendation allows you to obtain a card that allows you to legally purchase cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because it is NOT prescribed, the treatment course is self-determined and flexible.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A GOOD doctor will discuss treatment with the recommendation (kind of strains, amount, dosage, timing).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A crappy doctor just making cash from issuing recommendations will just say 'find what works,' or worse, 'have fun.'   I don't think cannabis consumption needs respect as much as it needs its deserved mundanity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is an effective medicine, but in my experience only in mild to medium efficacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would recommend it, for instance, for someone with mild/moderate, persistent anxiety.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But for real anxiety disorder, stronger medications (prescribed, measured and metered) are far better.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At its most effective, cannabis is an amazing palliative--it doesn't cure illness as often as make quality of life far better (for, e.g., controlling side effects of chemo or preventing MS attacks).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a palliative, it must be used according to each patient's need, which is best self-determined and self-administered.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Finally, its relative safety means that physicians are not worried about addiction or overdose, unlike many, many prescription meds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I just don't think cannabis, in its dried flower form, merits the kind of regulation you describe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It would be like prescribing wine or fiber.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>But for real anxiety disorder, stronger medications (prescribed, measured and metered) are far better.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was diagnosed in 4th grade and have had persistent panic attacks until I started medicating.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Due to how sensitive I am to chemicals (a 5mg dosage of Lexapro left my skin crawling), MM is the best treatment option I have.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This isn't some workaround, this is the best fix I have to a problem that nearly killed me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Don't just assume that someones disorder isn't real because you think that the treatment method is lackluster.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				**But**, having said that, you bring up a good point as to the recommendation vs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				the prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While it may be a palliative medication, other palliative medications such as analgesics, antidepressants, and steroids are specifically prescribed, so shouldn't Marijuana also be specifically prescribed?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As to your last point- I think that THC and CBD are in a weird medical area in between things like Red Wine (That have a proven benefit to cardiovascular health), and more serious Medications.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It helps people in a similar capacity to prescribed medications but has little-to-no danger attached to it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But it comes down to an essential question: Is Medical Marijuana a red herring- a stepping stone to legalization, or is it a legitimate plan of treatment for legitimate illnesses?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> But it comes down to an essential question: Is Medical Marijuana a red herring- a stepping stone to legalization, or is it a legitimate plan of treatment for legitimate illnesses?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your question is a false dilemma: it's absolutely possible that both of those things are true, or that neither are, or that the truth is something not mentioned in your framing of only two possible choices.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My own opinion is that if the latter is true, the former is not relevant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis is absolutely a plant with medical value, the medical community has consensus on this (as represented by the formal positions of, e.g., the American Medical Association).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think a reasonably informed argument can question its demonstrated medical efficacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That being true (and if you're someone who accepts empirical evidence, it is), whether or not some political actors may use medical marijuana as a stepping stone to legalization is beside the point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If cannabis has legitimate medical uses, there is no reason for its prohibition to include use for those.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A clear moral argument can, and has successfully been, made that it should be legal and available for those medical uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If medical marijuana is also being used politically as a stepping stone to legalization (I can't speculate as to the "real" intentions of the political actors in each state who helped bring the various laws into being, but would guess that some likely have this motive), it has nothing to do with the argument that a plant with proven medical efficacy should be available to those who need it; it is orthogonal to it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Possible political maneuvering by some actors does not undermine or render false the truth of the matter, nor the actual intent of the legislation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My sense of what is actually happening in California is that legal medical cannabis is increasing awareness of the absurdity of marijuana prohibition and the social harm that it creates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In that sense, yes, medical marijuana may be a stepping stone to legalization, but not by any intent.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If, by recognizing that a common, easy to grow and cultivate plant has numerous, proven and accepted medical uses and should thus be legally available to those whom it would help, general social awareness of the harms of marijuana prohibition is increased, well, isn't that a desirable side effect of doing the right thing?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Don't just assume that someones disorder isn't real because you think that the treatment method is lackluster.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I apologize for any offense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was unclear--I did not mean to trivialize or categorize as false anyone's illness.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was drawing a distinction between generalized anxiety and specific anxiety disorders (e.g., PTSD, OCD), which are typically much more severe and require more direct management and treatment by physicians.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My choice of the word "real" was for emphasis, to convey specificity and formality of diagnosis--and severity--as distinct from general anxiety and its symptoms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While cannabis can be quite effective for all of those, in my experience the more severe and specific forms of anxiety disorders need additional medicines to help ameliorate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should we subject marijuana to the same "big pharma" type of practices?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We should take this opportunity to promote alternative means of medicinal distribution.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				These are the precise people who *should* be kept out of the industry as it moves toward legitimacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Legalized marijuana is not legal for everyone, and it remains highly regulated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In order for a new legal regime for marijuana sales to work, the state/locality needs to be able to control who is buying and selling and under what conditions those sales are being made.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These people who you are speaking of have already demonstrated a willingness to sell illegal drugs in a manner prohibited by the state.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They have given the state reason to believe that they are more likely to sell marijuana in ways that are illegal even under a new regime.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The new law may say it is illegal to sell to 20 year olds, for instance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If the dealer has already demonstrated a willingness to sell illegal drugs in violation of the law, they shouldn't necessarily be trusted to abide by the regulations that will limit sales to people under 21 year olds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whether these specific restrictions on sales under a legalization regime make sense is a different question.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can probably make a good argument that marijuana shouldn't be so tightly controlled.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Given that it *is* going to be tightly controlled, however, the state should be keeping people who have already shown a willingness to flagrantly violate state drug laws out of the market to the extent possible.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So what you're getting at here is these people that made mistakes in their life, I'll admit not all of them with as noble a cause as some, do not deserve a second chance?	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				I've never seen anything so amazing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To ask a man in his late 30's to take up something new right when his trade is blossoming into a movement that, in a perfect world, he would be able to lend a hand and work alongside others to help people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because in a perfect world some people do learn loyalty, responsibility, remorse and get hit with a strong desire to help others after they've completely understood what it is he had done wrong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And he has an advantage having mastered said trade before it became so public.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My point is he can help.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With his knowledge he can help people which is ironically what he set out to do in the first place.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But now its legal to help people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And now you say he can't do it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because he went to jail for being a master of his craft.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why I don't want his help.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I just....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Can you just not see where I'm coming from?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think you're missing the point, which is that controlling distribution trumps letting people do whatever they like.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is what laws are all about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We don't let violent criminals become police officers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is not to punish them or because we don't think that they could handle the violence that is sometimes necessary.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's because they have already demonstrated that when it comes down to deciding what action to take, they will ignore the law and do what they want.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You just can't run a lawful society around the notion that laws are just suggestions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You might argue that it's unfair to assume that someone who has done it before will do it again, but decades of research disagrees with you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The goal is not to make your friend's life awesome.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's to avoid unlawful situations that are bad for everyone else.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your only option is to change the law, which will be very challenging because of the reasons I mentioned above.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why the law was made in the first place.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You make it seem like people are suffering without his help but that's not really true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He might be very good at what he does but so are many others that have not broken the law but still produce high quality weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also I doubt most people caught growing weed realized that they did something wrong just because they were arrested.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The way you describe it he sold weed to friends that needed it and that justifiers his actions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Such a person seems likely to sell weed to an underage friend for instance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a pretty big risk to take just so a person can have a second chance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You also make it seem like your friends life is ruined just because he can't grow weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But can't he use his skills in some other way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He can say teach others how to grow weed property or take care of some other plants.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He might make a pretty good gardener or florist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Didn't they still technically break the law when there was a law in place to be broken?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It only works that way when a law was unconstitutional, like the action should have never been illegal to begin with, which is not the case with marijuana	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> unfortunate enough to have been caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You mean they were breaking the law and got caught right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's what I mean.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And do you think there is a shortage of skilled growers to meet the demand in places where it's legal now?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would say no.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I'm not claiming a shortage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What I am saying is, if you're good at something, and that something is now legal for recreational use somewhere, with your skills and know how, and a strictly monitored transportation procedure, that means these guys should be given the opportunity to start some kind of enterprise of their own instead of having their only advantage over your average Joe yanked out from underneath them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They've already taken that hit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think they should be given the opportunity to take their life's experience and utilize it in a way that's going to turn their once bleek existence into a much more positive direction, doing what they wanted to do anyway but legally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana business is booming in select areas of the country, legal for recreational use but not legal for an excon to capitalize on because he has old drug charges.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These people have dreams and aspirations as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Equal opportunity isn't something that's good only when it applies to you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If they have the ability to jump through necessary hoops, doing everything legit in black and white, and they have the brain to grow, run a business and be foreman of trim or harvest crews, then they should be able to perform the trade they are most experienced in.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For instance, how many corner store owners out there do you think have done their time in jail....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe for robbing a convenience store.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That guy was not barred from opening a convenience store because he robbed one......	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He opened the convenience store given the opportunity because that's his right.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He would if that convenience store wanted to sell alcohol, this happens in other industries too, it's what happens when you choose to break the law, your limiting your future.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And really it's not like your friend and these other growers didn't know this could happen going in.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Honestly I think your a bit biased here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Half the convenience stores I go to don't sell alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Small profit to miss out on.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you think a little deeper, if he broke the law before, and you think he's going to break the law again by......	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tax evasion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Purchasing that convenience store and denying his ability to sell alcohol is not what's going to keep him from breaking the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He still has plenty of other opportunity to break the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What I'm trying to project on you is the idea of handing someone a job doing what they want to do while being completely in the right.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Call it a second chance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But a second chance doing what he's good at while being a productive member of society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So should stock traders who took advantage of their clients be allow to sell stocks again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should someone who had their license suspended for 5 years due to DUIs be allowed to drive school buses?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should doctors who sold drugs be allowed to practice medicine again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>So should stock traders who took advantage of their clients be allow to sell stocks again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is a very different situation because of the fiduciary responsibilities that financial professionals have to their client.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is a situation that would have involved a predator breech of that trust.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A guy who sells a joint under the table to a cancer patient isn't a parallel.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Should someone who had their license suspended for 5 years due to DUIs be allowed to drive school buses?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is a situation of high responsibility and life-and-death consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, the pattern of behavior involves drinking and driving, which is inherently dangerous to everyone around.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You don't have this problem with someone selling a joint under the table to a cancer patient, so this isn't a parallel either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The person selling the joint was not engaging in any predatory, deceptive or dangerously negligent behavior.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Should doctors who sold drugs be allowed to practice medicine again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Once again we are back to professional responsibilities and the potential danger of the situation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If a doctor buys generic Lipitor from India and sells it at cost to poor patients who cant afford their medicine, they are not engaged in anything predatory or dangerous even though they are breaking the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If they getting patients hooked on opiates and then dealing to them under the table, there are all kinds of dangerous, predatory and unprofessional things happening.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				None of this is paralleled in a marijuana grower selling a joint to a cancer patient under the table.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So should this apply to all convicted drug dealers/growers or just the genius ones, the good ones and the bad ones?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Generally speaking, we keep people out of jobs that would allow them to prey on people or endanger people if they have done so before.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This guy selling a joint to a cancer patient without a license is tantamount to a piano teacher giving lessons out of her house without a proper business license.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Did the doctor sell those drugs to someone that needed them under the table and cheaper because it was a life or death situation and that someone was maybe lacking insurance?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your second suggestion is a little over exaggerated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And wouldn't you say that's the coat of doing business when it comes to stocks?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Does the law differentiate good and bad drug dealing?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ponzi schemes are the cost of doing business?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I shouldn't have said anything about the stock market because I know nothing about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And no, the law does not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I do believe there are good people out there that break the law in an effort to get a step closer to that universal greater good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And dlto be honest, as you've probably picked up on, I'm not really a big fan of very many laws.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So we will continue clashing there.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should a person with a history of pedophilia work as a teacher?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If a person has ahistory of breaking the law in a spesific area, should we really trust them to work in that area legally?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For example- as far as I'm aware weed isn't legal in all the states, your friend grows weed in a legal state, sells in a legal state, but maybe he also sells in an illegal state.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You might say "He won't do that." Well, he already has.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To be honest, giving someone that opportunity, to do what they do legally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Personally I would cherish it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because at that point I have what I want.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think you'd be surprised at how much someone can change when they need for nothing and their life is in order.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>  Personally I would cherish it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				you aren't an accurate representation of everyone though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> I think you'd be surprised at how much someone can change[...]  Not everybody does change, and putting somebody in a situation where they may be tempted to break the law as they previously have done just seems idiotic to me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>when they need for nothing and their life is in order.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And growing weed would acomplish this for your friend?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They wouldn't even be slightly tempted to sell across a state border where they could significantly up their prices and further improve their standard of living?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Given that that's EXACTLY what he's done in the past I don't see any reason to trust him not to do so again.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Oh, for fuck's sake!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are talking about a horrendously predatory act and it isn't a reasonable comparison at all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A proper parallel would be a teacher who was running a tutoring service without all of the right licenses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you think that kind of history is so bad that they should never teach again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Training to be a teacher takes a long time, and a lot of money.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Training to grow weed isn't even a thing, this isn't something that can be considered "wasteful", preventing a teacher from teaching?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's a waste of the money, and time spent training them, preventing this guys friend from growing weed doesn't even come close to being considered wasteful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you also not believe in the benefits it provides medically?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why isn't it considered wasteful?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because what exactly is it a waste of?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				His skills as a grower?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm sure there are many many more willing to take his place- if they don't have enough positions to accomodate each and every single one is that a waste too?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No, of course not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As to the medical stuff, it's irrelivant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not talking about the benefits of weed, it doesn't come into it.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				You make a good argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Put quite simply:  > The guy is good at doing something.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That something was illegal when he was doing it, but now it isn't.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When it was illegal, he was caught doing it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It would be good to allow him to continue doing it, now that it's legal, even though he was caught, because he's good at it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So, so far, your argument could be split up into two parts:  1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You argue that he should be allowed into this business because he is good at it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You argue that he shouldn't *not* be allowed into this business because though he was caught doing something against the law, that something is now legal, which would mean there shouldn't be any problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'll respond to each point in turn.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For 1, you have a good point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I'm good at something, it makes sense that it would be beneficial to let me do it, right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is a good argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For 2...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not so much.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				See, there are two ways of looking at this:   * On one hand, your friend got busted doing weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Weed is now *legal,* so that charge shouldn't be worth shit now.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				* On the other hand, your friend got caught breaking the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From this point of view it doesn't really matter what law it was — what matters is that there *was,* in fact, a law, and your friend *did,* in fact, know there was a law, and your friend *did,* in fact, knowingly break it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From this perspective, it doesn't matter if the law *changes* — because from this perspective, the punishment isn't for *doing weed,* it's for *breaking the law* in general.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No matter how laws change, they must be followed; that's a cornerstone of civilization, and your friend went ahead and broke a law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now, from this point of view, it doesn't actually matter whether or not weed is legal; what matters is that there are regulations about weed at *all,* whether they prohibit it, allow it, or just heavily regulate it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Furthermore, it doesn't matter whether or not weed *was* legal — again, what matters is that there were regulations on it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So, from this perspective, it doesn't matter that weed *wasn't* legal, and now *is* — all that matters is that there was a set of regulations, and that set of regulations is still there, just modified to a certain degree.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From this perspective, we can see that your friend wasn't just doing weed — they were violating regulations.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now, as far as lawmakers go, it is in their best interests to get people to obey regulations.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's the whole point; there need to be rules, because rules create more stability than a lack of rules would, and because stability makes people's lives easier (and makes civilization possible).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				*yada yada yada* [insert justification for making laws].	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Based on this idea, there's no *room* for second chances.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There *can't* be, because it would imply that at least *some* of the time, it would be legal do disobey laws, a contradiction.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even worse, it would imply that the law is not universal, because some people (those who haven't wasted their "second chance" yet) would be exempt from various consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anyway, you see where I'm going with this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				From the perspective of growing weed specifically, you might have a point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But from a big-picture perspective — the only *fair* perspective — your friend broke the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Breaking the law has consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Breaking the law means you *could* do it again.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Breaking the law means being restricted in what one can or cannot do.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's all I got, anyway.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That would also mean that incarceration is literally just a means of creating revenue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That the country doesn't have faith in their own system of rehabilitation that is supposed to teach right from wrong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Good from bad.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Instead you release said individual from jail oftentimes with nothing or no one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No other skills to fall back on and not a dollar in their pocket.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Literally nothing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which in turn would lead to breaking the law again and creating more revenue for private prisons.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like I said.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a damn shame and a waste.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While I respect your view for what it is, it still fails to change my view about the law completely taking away all your credibility and ability to help where your help would provide a substantial service to society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I see your point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I don't think that's quite the case here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is he barred completely from *any* means of earning money?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is he left with *no* way out?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or is it just *this* business that he can't get into?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes it's just this business.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But this is the life he knows.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I suppose he could get a job on a farm growing something else.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But he has literally devoted his life to perfecting his product.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He doesn't know anything else and he got some serious social anxiety issues.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That he USED to smoke weed for.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now he can't do that either because you also can't get a medical card here with drug charges on your record....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which also doesn't make any sense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He's in his late 30's.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact is he CAN get another job in a different field sure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But that's not what my argument was about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The jobs you're describing are unskilled.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People in these jobs are basically interchangeable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, there is special know-how that goes into growing and harvesting, but like any farm/orchard, you really only need one person to make decisions and an unskilled crew to follow orders.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no waste in barring some people who have been caught breaking the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no shortage of more reliable people capable of running a grow-op.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				More reliable?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think that's kind of an unfair judgement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean sure, when you hear of someone being in the slammer, its doesn't exactly fill your head with an image of the most upstanding individual.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But assuming immediately that someone is unreliable just because of a bad decision they made once is one of the leading factors in extended unemployment and return rate amongst ex convicts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I also didn't specify the positions these theoretical people would be posted at.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So I wouldn't say the jobs I'm describing are unskilled because I didn't actually describe any one position.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was just pointing out the fact that severing ties to the ability to perform a trade these ex cons worked a good part of their life mastering is, like I said above, wasteful and counterproductive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> bad decision they made once  You made it sound like your friend grew quite often and shared his illegal goods with multiple people	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd have to say the bad decision in this case was tearing ass up and down his street while he test rode a dirt bike while sunning a plant in the backyard in plain view through the open garage door.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which ....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm sure you can guess what happened after that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But breaking the law by growing pot wasn't a bad decision too?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your friend obviously had to know he was taking a risk by doing that	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I never said that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Clearly it was a bad decision.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why we do jail time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To repay that debt to society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				.and still pay cash out the wazoo for court fees and the like.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But you're missing the point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This wasnt about whether or not it was a bad decision to grow bud in the first place.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is about carrying on with your life with equal opportunity in a legal fashion after all is said and done.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He can, but not in that industry, we determine that some people can't work in certain industries all the time, why should pot be different?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you have previous charges for marijuana in Colorado, Oregon, Washington state, D.C.,  anywhere else its been legalized for recreational use, are you, the person with the past drug related offenses banned from indulging in that herbal goodness?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So its legal to indulge, but not legal for them to set up shop and legally sell a legal substance in a state where its legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No it was illegal when they did it, just because it's legal now does not unburden you of your previous crime	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But, strangely enough, neither does incarceration, fines or ten years incident free.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So once you fuck up, you're just screwed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Every human is just incapable of rehabilitation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can't come back from a mistake.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You might as well hang yourself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is that it?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Federally it is still illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I go and commit (and am convicted of) a federal felony instead of a state one I still have to fill out the form and say I'm a convicted felon.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				State law explicitly makes these uses of marijuana LEGAL.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The 10th Amendment dictates that any powers not given to the federal government by the Constitution are in the states' domain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The Constitution does not delegate the power to make marijuana illegal to the federal government, therefore state legislation declaring  marijuana legal negates any federal legislation to the contrary, as long as marijuana use conforms with the limitations of the individual state's law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				EDIT: Spelling	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's basic powers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A state can't over ride the federal government the best they can do is refuse to enforce it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The courts have already ruled that indeed the federal government can make drugs illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So unless your cmv is "cmv the Feds cannot make any substances illegal" I think that the basic points stand.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				- being an illegal immigrant in a sanctuary city doesn't make you a legal immigrant   - a state cannot refuse to recognize gay marriage   - owning a machine gun in Alaska without a class 3 is still illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not enforcing a law doesn't make it legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The courts determined prohibitions against gay marraige to be unconstitutional infringement upon an individuals right to the pursuit of happiness, something which could also be used to argue in favor of marijuana legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Regardless, the states' right to enact laws making medical marijuana uses legal are in fact constitutional as long as they don't violate interstate commerce.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Federal attempts to override state law on this issue are unconstitutional without an Amendment to the Constitution (pursuant laws referenced in Article VI).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				EDIT: Spelling	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> prohibitions against gay marraige to be unconstitutional infringement upon an individuals right to the pursuit of happiness  Uhhh...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				no, not at all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They ruled against gay marriage bans because of due process and equal protection, not "pursuit of happiness."  The "pursuit of happiness" phrase is part of the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Regardless, the states' right to enact laws making medical marijuana uses legal are in fact constitutional as long as they don't violate interstate commerce  The Supreme Court ruled in *Gonzales v.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Raich* that even if marijuana is consumed and grown locally, that transaction still affects the national market.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, according to the SC, it's impossible to grow/consume marijuana without affecting interstate commerce and opening yourself up to federal prosecution.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The federal government is choosing not to enforce federal marijuana law in states that have legalized it, but it would be constitutional for them to do so if they wished.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hence "a perversion of the law".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you grow something and consume it for yourself you're affecting the "national market" for marijuana, which according to law does not exist, by supplying your own demand and thus removing any necessity for interstate commerce?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If that isn't a corrupt and perverted interpretation of the law then I don't know what is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The current policy of the federal government is to not apply federal resources to enforcing federal law in state jurisdictions where parties involved are adhering to state law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know "pursuit of happiness" is in the declaration and has nothing to do with constitutional law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was using it as shorthand to refer to equal protection of civil liverties, and said that was another argument one could pursue, though not the one I'm currently employing so not the one I was going to put any effort into defending.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was simply mentioning that the federal government has the power to prevent the states from enacting laws which infringe upon citizens' civil liberties.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In this situation that role is being reversed, the states are preventing the federal government from infringing upon it's constituents' civil liberties.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The federal government would need to pass a constitutional amendment to prohibit in-state commerce of medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Seeing as 89% of voters agree with me (http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/quinnipiac-poll-89-percent-voters-support-medical-marijuana.html) that seemly highly politically unlikely.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, they could very well do that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They could very well rule that marijuana makes you happy and we have a right to be happy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's a moot point though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your view, as it says in the title, is that currently users of medical marijuana have the right to bear arms by virtue of it being legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is demonstrably illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For this view, that should be the end of the discussion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If your view is actually that it should NOT be illegal, then that's an entirely different issue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In Gonzales v.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Raich the Supreme Court held that the federal government can criminalize marijuana, even if it is grown at home for medical purposes in a state where it is legal, under the interstate commerce clause.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my view this is a perversion of the law in that not only is interstate commerce prohibited by state medical marijuana laws, but homegrows for personal use could not even be classified as commerce because the producer is the consumer and no transfer of goods for monetary value ever occurs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In-state commerce of medical marijuana, such as at dispensaries and clinics, is explicitly for holders of that state's medical marijuana ID.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was in LA on a 12 hour layover and had banked on using my MA medical card to stop by a dispensary and grab something for the wait.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was refused entry into the dispensary because I lacked proof of California residence, my out of state MMJ license could not be accepted in order for the state to be federally compliant with regard to interstate commerce.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Disagreeing with a law doesn't void it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think the government should be able to tell me I need a class 3 to own a silencer but if i get a silencer without a license I'm still in trouble.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can argue all day long and maybe even get it over turned, but until that day the law states what the law states.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The legal decision states what a corrupt judge's opinion of the law is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When the right attention is brought to the issue and that decision is revealed to be flawed based on how the laws actually stand, it will be reversed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It doesn't matter what you think about needing a Class 3 for your machine gun or silencer, that's your state's laws and they have the consitutional right to enact them, just as they have the constitutional right to determine laws regarding anything not explicitly granted to the federal government in the constitution, or pursuant to the Constitution such as with a constitutional amendment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Laws not pursuant to the Constitution, which have no constitutional basis, are not covered by Article VI.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Abortion isn't in it but they cover it under privacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Calling the court "corrupt" doesn't legalize pot.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact is right now it is illegal federally and the courts (who determine if a law is constitutional) have decided it is constitutional.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whether or not you agree does not matter.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is illegal use, every court has ruled so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				there off it is still illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hence "a perversion of the law".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you grow something and consume it for yourself you're affecting the "national market" for marijuana, which according to law does not exist, by supplying your own demand and thus removing any necessity for interstate commerce?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If that isn't a corrupt and perverted interpretation of the law then I don't know what is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The current policy of the federal government is to not apply federal resources to enforcing federal law in state jurisdictions where parties involved are adhering to state law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know "pursuit of happiness" is in the declaration and has nothing to do with constitutional law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was simply mentioning that the federal government has the power to prevent the states from enacting laws which infringe upon citizens' civil liberties.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In this situation that role is being reversed, the states are preventing the federal government from infringing upon it's constituents' civil liberties.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The federal government would need to pass a constitutional amendment to prohibit in-state commerce of medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Seeing as 89% of voters agree with me (http://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/quinnipiac-poll-89-percent-voters-support-medical-marijuana.html) that seemly highly politically unlikely.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are not a lawyer and you are simply misunderstanding the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				- interstate commerce does apply to production.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				the same reason I can't make my own grenades.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				- not enforcing a law isn't legalizing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				- speeding makes me happy, still illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				- and more than half of people were against interracial marriage when the Supreme Court ruled that should be legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The reason we don't elect Supreme Court judges is because the judicial branch is supposed to be free from the ever changing majority.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most of your argument comes from a poor understanding of the constitution, I know it sounds rude but it's true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The Supreme Court found abortion in the 4th, gay marriage in the 1st.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They took into account things that you may not have considered (common law, history, letters from the founders, British law that our constitution is based off of).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The courts have already ruled on this, it isn't perverting justice because you don't understand it	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're either not a lawyer yourself or only have a very narrow vision of the workings and interpretation of law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Discrediting me due to my chosen profession is a weak tactic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hand grenade production is illegal because it's military hardware and probably covered under some international rules of warfare.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Speeding is illegal because youre infringing on the rights of others to safe transport on the roads.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Interracial and same-sex marraige is equal protection.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Baby would have protection if recognized as a person under law, which it isn't currently because this is deemed a religious question and not the scientifically inherent fact it should be.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can continue to cite all the court decisions you want, but that doesnt preclude us from having ongoing discussions over whether those interpretations are valid or were misguided.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The recent decision by the court was that states have the right to prohibit mmj cardholders from having a LTC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does not say that states must prevent mmj cardholders from owning firearms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Despite all that, the Supreme Court has ruled and declared it to be constitutional.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And the CMV is about what the law is, not what you think it ought to be.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This CMV is about interpretation of the law, not exclusively the recent edict of the Ninth Circuit (not the SCOTUS).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				they determined the states had the right to deny sales of firearms to mmj patients.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The patient admitted she had a card (did not smoke, only owned the card as a show of political support, could even be an operative of the opposition), was denied sale, and this was determined not to be a violation of the 2nd Amendment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The decision does not mandate that all states forbid sales of firearms to mmj patients, only that they have the constitutional authority to do so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are dozens of federal agencies that are unconstitutional according to the 10th Amendment, but FDR and his manipulation of the SCOTUS lead to perversions of the commerce clause which are used as precedence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is the correct ruling.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Form 4473 is a federal form, https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download and when answering question 11e it doesn't matter what your state says.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Federal law applies here, it is still illegal on a federal level, and this ruling is correct.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should it be legalized federally?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Totally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But until that happens, state level legality is totally irrelevant as far as gun purchasing goes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				11e even makes the transfer of a firearm illegal if you are a "drunk", which is not illegal to be in and of itself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would award delta to this response.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Though I'm not 100% sure this is what the recent ruling requires.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think theyre still leaving it up to the states to prohibit sales to mmj cardholders, not requiring them to divert any resources to doing so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's totally a federal thing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The state has nothing to do with it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Source: I'm a gunsmith.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This thread should go to the top as it's actually the one that changed my opinion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sick to my stomach arguing with all these other people over whether medical marijuana in and of itself is even constitutionally legal in states where it's been established so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would still check 'No' if my state did not explicitly have a law forbidding sale of firearms to state mmj patients.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This would differ from the recent case in which an admitted mmj patient tried to purchase a firearm and was denied.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my case I'd be claiming my use was lawful and force the federal government to prove my use was unlawful, which they have yet to do.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't plan on buying a gun in the near future, I plan to live in a state where it's legal and then not have a card and avoid the confrontation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When I'm ready to purchase a firearm I'll reassess the legal situation, but for now I'm content with access to medical grade cannabis flower and extract from state certified retailers.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Please don't come to my shop.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				( It's not in a state where MMJ is legal, so I don't think you'll be visiting soon ;) )	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Δ I realize you would be subjecting yourself to the state's determination of policy with regard to this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If states decide to restrict the right to own firearms for medical marijuana cardholders, they have the backing of the federal government to do so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If states decide to allow sales of firearms to medical marijuana cardholders, they also have the right to do so and the onus would be on the federal government to come in and prosecute an as yet unheard of legal situation.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Clarifying question:  Is this a state form or a federal form?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Who is asking?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not OP it's a federal form.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is a federal form (Form 4473, Question 11e).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My standpoint is not whether marijuana is federally illegal, it is clearly illegal under federal law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The issue is that there are state laws concerning the same material, which trump federal law according to the tenth amendment and should therefore constitutionally shield medical marijuana users from discrimination under federal law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Article VI of the Constitution states that when federal law and state law conflict, federal law wins.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The tenth amendment does not, in any way, imply supremacy of state law over federal law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Article VI actually backs my argument: "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."  There has not been an amendment to the constitution prohibiting marijuana, as was required for alcohol prohibition.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Someone mentioned below that federal laws prohibiting marijuana were upheld pursuant to regulation of interstate commerce.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my view this is a perversion of the law in that not only is interstate commerce prohibited by state medical marijuana laws, but  homegrows for personal use could not even be classified as commerce because the producer is the consumer and no transfer of goods for monetary value ever occurs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Federal laws prohibiting marijuana are not pursuant to anything in the Constitution and are therefore, absent a constitutional amendment, left to the states.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The Supreme Court disagrees with you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you are unwilling to accept that their rulings are in fact the law of the land, then there is nothing that can change your view and you are not posting this in good faith.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The states' right to enact laws making medical marijuana uses legal are in fact constitutional as long as they don't violate interstate commerce.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Federal attempts to override state law on this issue are unconstitutional without an Amendment to the Constitution ("pursuant" laws referenced in Article VI).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[removed]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can continue to cite all the court decisions you want, but that doesnt preclude us from having ongoing discussions over whether those interpretations are valid or were misguided.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The recent decision by the Ninth-Circuit (not the SCOTUS) was that states have the right to prohibit mmj cardholders from having a LTC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does not say that states must prevent mmj cardholders from owning firearms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually the ruling had nothing to do with a License to carry.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The 4473 is what a buyer fills out when purchasing a firearm.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sorry, knew that but the ruling is that states can constitutionally restrict the right to even have a LTC too.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree that we can have ongoing discussions about the validity of the decisions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But the view you stated in the original post was about the current actual state of the law, not about what we think the law should be.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And under current law, your view is not correct.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Current ruling on the law is that states can restrict guns rights of mmj patients and this would not be a violation of the 2nd Amendment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does not say that current state laws establishing protection for medical or recreational consumers are not considered valid under the constitution.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While it does not imply legalization, current federal policy is to show deference to the states on the issue of legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				89% of US voters support medical marijuana, while 54% support outright legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If this issue came to a head where the federal government tried to shut down state marijuana legalization altogether, there would be a huge political backlash.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Any effective control they have over prohibiting a substance as benign as marijuana is rapidly eroding.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				EDIT: Spelling	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> The recent decision by the Ninth-Circuit (not the SCOTUS) was that states have the right to prohibit mmj cardholders from having a LTC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does not say that states must prevent mmj cardholders from owning firearms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's because states *don't* have to prohibit medical marijuana cardholders from owning firearms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What's your point?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				States don't have to prohibit convicted felons from owning firearms either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nor do they have to prohibit people from lying to the IRS.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nor do they have to make it a crime to sell nuclear secrets, or manufacture nerve gas, or commit copyright infringement, or counterfeit US currency, or commit treason.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The federal government generally cannot force states to do its dirty work.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They can't *interfere* with federal enforcement of federal law; they do not need to actively cooperate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So a state is free to not ban medical marijuana cardholders from carrying a gun, just as it's free to not ban felons from carrying.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's a good chance it could even issue carry permits to either group.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But the form you're talking about isn't about state laws.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not trying to enforce a state policy of "unlawful drug users can't carry." It's asking the question because of a *federal* law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even if your state doesn't ban you from owning a gun, it doesn't mean you're not committing a federal crime by owning it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ditto with selling it to you: a state doesn't have to say "you can't sell to felons," but that doesn't mean the feds can't say "you can't sell to felons."	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I'm saying the ruling does state that states have the right to prohibit sales to medical marijuana cardholders, but it does not say that it would be against federal law for them to allow it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The question asks if you are an unlawful user of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm saying that they are lawful users because federal laws prohibiting marijuana have no basis in the constitution, are an infringement upon an individual's civil liberties, and state laws protecting marijuana users make their usage lawful, given no constitutional amendment to prohibit it.previous interpretations in courts have decided otherwise, but given current polling on the issue maintaining those stances will become increasingly difficult.

medical marijuana				As many users have pointed out, from the point of view of the american legal system, federal law trumps state law 10 times out of 10 when it comes to legislation concerning illicit drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your view is that medical marijuana cardholders are LAWFUL users of marijuana..., and this is demonstrably false.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no such thing in the American legal system, at this moment, as a lawful user of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is because marijuana is classified as a schedule 1 narcotic under federal law, which trumps state law every time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now, your argument is that the federal government does not have the right to control drug use, and that this is not a power that it is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However the supremacy clause, which is in the constitution, makes it entirely clear that if it ever comes down to a conflict between state law and federal laws passed by congress, that federal laws reign supreme every single time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In any case this I think this point is sort of moot.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your argument is that medical marijuana cardholders are lawful users of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Under federal law they are not lawful users since there are no lawful users.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's about all there is to say on that matter.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With all this being said, if you would argue that federal law should be changed on the basis of unconstitutionality, then that is a point that is not moot.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However the unconstitutionality of a law is something that is ultimately to be decided by the courts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact that the constitutionality of a law is currently in question and up for debate does not mean that said law does not apply while it is being debated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It most certainly does.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is the federal law on drugs and prohibition currently unconstitutional?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not sure ; there are arguments on both sides to be made that hold validity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While that is being debated however, the law is still valid and via the supremacy clause, since it was passed by congress, it trumps  state law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To conclude ; your view as it stands in the title is demonstrably false.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical marijuana cardholders are not lawful users of marijuana since marijuana is a schedule 1 narcotic under federal law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Due to the supremacy clause which applies to legislation passed by congress, the federal statue of marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic trumps the legislation of a state concerning it's legality for medical use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, at the moment, the claim made in your title is demonstrably false.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would recommend clarifying what your view is, because from your posts I'm getting the impression that it's actually that "medical marijuana cardholders SHOULD have the right to bear arms", and not that they DO have the right.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because currently it is a fact that they do not, and that the fact that they do not is within the confines of the law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a side note, I am personally for the legalization of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would like to see it done legally though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm saying that there is no constitutional basis for the federal law prohibiting marijuana, it is unconstitutional because it is a cultivar with origins thousands of years B.C.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				as medicine and specifically for religious use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no basis for prohibition on the grounds of safety as it has no demonstrable toxicity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is unconstitutional so the federal government will do everything it can to prevent direct conflict on the issue from reaching the higher courts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is unconstitutional because the Supremacy Clause applies to federal laws outlined in, and pursuant to, the Constitution, and nowhere in the Constitution is there outlined a power of the federal government, regardless of the actions of Congress, to prohibit a non-toxic substance used historically purely for the purpose of inducing a spiritual state of greater communion with the Divine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because it is unconstitutional, regardless of existing decisions in the higher courts, lawful marijuana users in states where it is legal for any purpose can safely purchase firearms and answer 'No' to the question of whether they are unlawful users of marijuana, because their state has enacted laws defending their marijuana usage as lawful, and the federal government has no constitutional basis for prohibiting it's use and therefore will never challenge the authority of states to approve the sale of firearms to marijuana cardholders, because a state victory over the federal government on the issue of marijuana prohibition would mean the end of marijuana prohibition entirely in any state that doesn't make it explicitly illegal themselves.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				State medical marijuana patients can thus safely and LAWFULLY obtain firearms by claiming with Divine authority to be LAWFUL users of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				EDIT: Grammar  Note: This stance presumes the actor to have full knowledge and preparedness for defense of their religious liberty in federal court.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The basis for a drug's legality, or lack thereof, is NOT it's toxicity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The basis of a drug's legality is whether or not it poses a harm to society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The question is then whether or not marijuana poses a risk to society as a whole.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is a question that legislators address while passing legislation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you would like to argue that the basis for it's illegality is invalid, then that's a perfectly reasonable argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In the mean-time though marijuana remains illegal, and it is therefore not legal for individuals who smoke marijuana to have a firearm, since criminals cannot own firearms, and anyone smoking marijuana is, according to federal law, a criminal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And stating that it is unconstitutional because it has a history of religious use is not an argument that it is unconstitutional.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is also a rich tradition of human sacrifice in Aztec and polytheistic religions going back thousands of years ; we most certainly don't argue that people can sacrifice others on religious grounds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Granted,  human sacrifice is much much different than smoking marijuana, but the supreme court has already ruled that one does not have the right to do things that the government, aka the legislature, has made illegal on the grounds of your religious beliefs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The employment division vs smith was a supreme court case.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smith claimed that he should be allowed to use peyote because it is a part of his religion.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				There is nothing unconstitutional, according to the highest court in this country, about criminalizing and penalizing individuals for taking drugs in accordance with their religious beliefs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This was on the state level, but given the supremacy clause it's a safe bet to say that the federal government would have the same power.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't get to just say that opium is part of my ancient chinese religion going back hundreds to thousands of years and that I should be allowed to smoke it and own a firearm...., given that, like marijuana, it impairs my ability to function coherently and therefore renders me unfit to be in possession of a firearm.

medical marijuana				There is nothing unconstitutional, according to the highest court in this country, about criminalizing and penalizing individuals for taking drugs in accordance with their religious beliefs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This was on the state level, but given the supremacy clause it's a safe bet to say that the federal government would have the same power."  So states can allow otherwise illegal religious actions, but you're saying they wouldn't be allowed to recognize scientifically validated medical use, as they have been doing virtually unchallenged by the Federal government (except for small time gangbanger extortion-style raids by the DEA)?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it's a safe bet then why haven't they challenged state level legalization in the SCOTUS?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"I don't get to just say that opium is part of my ancient chinese religion going back hundreds to thousands of years and that I should be allowed to smoke it and own a firearm...., given that, like marijuana, it impairs my ability to function coherently and therefore renders me unfit to be in possession of a firearm."   As I said in another post which you attempted to rebut, marijuana has exhibited nearly nonexistent levels of  toxicity and is shown to be less habit forming than either caffeine, alcohol, tobacco or even sugar.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As you said legality of a substance isn't determined by toxicity, but by harm to society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It looks like science validates marijuana as safer to society than many other federally legal substances, and policy is imminently adapting to reflect that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not federally legal yet, but as established above the federal government refuses to directly confront the states about the issue in the Supreme Court so it appears state level legality will hold firm pending conformity of federal legislation with the will of voters and with absolute biochemical reality.

medical marijuana				But weed is legal where I live (Colorado).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Images of grandma toking from a bong (if that ever really came up, I don't think it did) didn't stop it from being voted for as legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doesn't that contradict most of what you're saying?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It might.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I could just as easily argue that legalization came in spite of the points I raised.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe it would have happened sooner, or maybe the vote would have been more in favor of legalization, if medical marijuana wasn't such a thinly-veiled ruse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I think you misunderstood what I was saying about the image of grandma toking from a bong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not saying that that image would scare someone and prevent them from favoring legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm just saying that it's a ridiculous image, and it demonstrates how advocates' claims about medical marijuana probably aren't true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Dispensaries are selling strains called OG Kush and AK-47 and Green Crack, but at the same time they seem to want you to believe that medical marijuana exists to help cancer patients and people with chronic pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm just saying it's a very contrasting image, and it's probably not really true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No grandma is going to go into some dispensary, buy a bag of AK-47 and then smoke it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				1) agreed 2) probably true 3) I don't see any evidence to support this.  If you have cancer and weed is the only way you can get through chemo, you'll suck it up and go to the  hippy-infested pot shop whether or not it appeals to you.  In fact, you may be thankful about all the 'fakers' in there.  Without them, the market would be much smaller and you'd have to drive 4 towns over to find what you need, if it's even available at all. 4) I'd legalize it if I were king, but there's a reason that 20 something states have legal medical marijuana and just 2 have legal recreational marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sometimes, in a democracy, you have to take what you can get based on current public opinion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>If you have cancer and weed is the only way you can get through chemo,  Why does it have to be marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are other drugs that have the same neurological effects of marijuana, without the high that comes with marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For example, [Nabilone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabilone) is already FDA approved in the United States (and has been for the last 20 years) and is currently used to reduce nausea/vomitiing in chemo patients and aiding in weight gain in patients with AIDS and anorexia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Trials have also been done examining its effectiveness in reducing symptoms from Parkinsons, chronic pain, and anxiety/PTSD.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Perhaps other drugs work for some people, but not for everyone.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why take Vicodin for pain when you can just take ibuprofen, which doesn't have the same high?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If a doctor and patient agree that marijuana is the best medicine for their situation, why stop them?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your comparison between Vicodin and ibuprofen does not apply to this situation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Vicodin alters endogenous opioid systems in your brain, ibuprofen does not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nabilone and marijuana literally influence the exact same systems in the brain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So then why have more than oe type of opioid?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why have more than one antibiotic?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can pick at my metaphors all day, but the point is that doctors will when choosing between similar drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We leave it up to them to decide for each patient with other drugs, including more dangerous ones..	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is complex.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It includes multiple active agents in different quantities depending on breed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Who are you to declare that it can always be substituted by one particular name-brand drug?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why does your judgement trump the many doctors who have chosen to prescribe marijuana instead?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a political issue, the public's opinion is evolving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's too jarring for the public to go from it being 100% illegal to 100% legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So medical marijuana is an intermediate step.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's similar to how civil rights for African Americans didn't come all at once.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It had to happen in steps, from the abolition of slavery, to the right to vote, to the integration of schools, to the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, to electing an African American president.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The public would not have dealt well with electing an African American president right after the abolition of slavery.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Same with gay marriage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For over a decade, the fight was for "civil unions" and "domestic partnerships".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Those were intermediate steps towards marriage equality, which is the legalization of gay marriage nationwide.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So medical marijuana is like a civil union.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It gets you a lot of what you want, but not everything.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Intermediate steps are necessary in any long term political battle like this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So medical marijuana does not hurt the movement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its successful implementation gives an example to the other states that marijuana can be legal without any real negative consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Plus it's a great source of tax revenue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The success of the medical marijuana program in Colorado led to the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado starting January 1, 2014.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The path towards full legalization of recreational marijuana nationwide is inevitable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just like the path towards gay marriage being legal in all fifty states is inevitable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I am correct, your view is that most using medical marijuana don't have valid medical reasons for using it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To reach that conclusion, you'd have to know that most or a good number of those who have medical marijuana are just trying to get high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In all the US states that allow for medical marijuana, you need a doctor's prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In theory that assessment would see whether someone was using for medically necessary reasons.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In practice, we know that these sorts of things can be gamed and there are many doctors who are known to write prescriptions for anyone who wants one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This may be the same case for other prescription drugs including painkillers and psych medications that have worse side effects and addictive properties.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This also can the case with other types of medications that may not be medically necessary such as antibiotics for a non-bacterial or nonexistent infection.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is kind of the same kind of thing for the whole prescription industry.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>(3) The fact that medical marijuana is such a thinly-veiled joke hurts the overall cause.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You could make the opposite argument by claiming that in-spite of all these healthy people lying in order to get high, it's proven in a roundabout way that marijuana legalization is harmless.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even with all the lying over medicinal purposes, people are peacefully buying, selling, producing marijuana with the economic benefits outweighing the costs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical is the way to go.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				simple legalization is to easy to discriminate against.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If its legal jobs, and various forms of government can still discriminate against users, just like they do with alcohol (which is legal), but if someone has a prescription for medicine that they need, then all of that is illegal discrimination, and it cannot be done.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The states that go the medical route are doing it the correct way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Granny is pro - she only smokes hash out of a rhinestone eyed skull tweak pipe while listening to Colt 45 by Afroman.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What on earth does any of that have to do with capitalism?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not sure I really understand your beef with NIDA.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They do fun lots of marijuana research and the only reason there isn't more is because of the scheduling, which they have nothing to do with.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is purely political and not scientific at all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it wasn't scheduled, you'd see an explosion in research, probably showing beneficial and jo so beneficial effects (like every psychoactive substance known to man).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like i said in my original post, NIDA has only provided smoked marijuana research to the subcommittee on criminal justice, drug policy and HR and highlight harmful chemicals that are as a result of smoking marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is consumed in many ways aside from smoking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In addition, they refuse to collaborate and verify research that shows the immense medical properties of marijuana which in turn can lead to rescheduling of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Meaningful legalization wouldn't just be medical marijuana as those groups have an impact on.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It would be recreational marijuana, and the DEA need not believe in safety or efficacy for that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The biggest opponents of recreational Federal legalization are prison unions, police unions, for profit prisons, and of course the ~half of Americans who oppose it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Congress, and the United Nations narcotics convention treaty, enforce on ONDCP, DEA, and HHS what is a scheduled substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is why the Netherlands does not have legal marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like the states, it has local legal marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your beef is with congress.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Congress mandates cannabis as Schedule I.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Until 2014 it mandated hemp was Schedule I.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is nothing the executive branch can do here because it would violate law and treaty.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Congress in other scenarios has delegated authority to DEA to add new drugs to the schedule as policy in lieu of law.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Congress has never allowed DEA to make an independent decision about a past schedule for enactment by congress, because congress is supreme in the regulation of interstate commerce and defense policy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These bodies (NIDA & NDCP) provide research data that the DEA considers in addressing the congressional subcommittee on criminal justice, drug policy and HR in regards to rescheduling controlled substances.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If they are providing outdated, biased and incompetent research, my beef is with them, not congress.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors would argue that smoking and alcohol should be banned because it's as bad as marijuana, not marijuana should be legal because it's as safe as smoking or alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most doctors aren't interested in study marijuana as a cure for disease because it's not a very promising substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If marijuana had any promise of being actually useful, it would be studied more.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				CBD and THC are well within the range of pseudoscience, just like essential oils, acupuncture, and other substances of limited clinical significance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some people point to seizure prevention as a medical use, but it's a stretch.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's mostly used as evidence by people who want to legalize marijuana, not people who are actually interested in curing disease.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now there is interested in studying marijuana amongst physicians, but only because so many people do it and they want to see it's effects on the population.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If real scientists actually wanted to study marijuana, they could easily push the government to let them do so.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The AMA is one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the US.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors just don't see the clinical value in it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				3.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Capitalists want marijuana to be legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The more addictive stuff you can legally sell to people, the more money you make.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When Diageo saw that whiskey sales were doing well, they bought more whiskey brands.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When they saw beer rise in popularity, they bought more beer brands.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest investors in green energy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tyson Foods is a major investor in vegan "meat." Their goal is making money, not forcing people to buy a specific product.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				McDonald's doesn't care if you buy a burger or a salad because they profit off of both.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Before the downvotes pour in, I'm all for legalizing marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But some of the conspiracy theories around why pot is illegal don't make sense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Doctors want to help people stay alive, governments want to support a well functioning society, and capitalists want to invest in innovative ideas that will improve the future (because it makes them money).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There isn't an evil cabal that's just trying to screw potheads over.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				I can give you tons of evidence cannabis actually has medical benefits on most of those diseases.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't even know where to continue right now, there's so much to unfold here and show you it's unbelievable.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's literally a freakin medicine too, nothing less, I can tell you from first hand experience.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				There are supposed "real scientists" in NIDA  who only provide smoked marijuana data to the subcommittee on criminal justice, drug policy and HR while marijuana is consumed in very many forms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How is that valid data representation from a supposedly well-meaning body?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Look up Insys Therapeutics and what they did in Arizona to keep marijuana illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They are a capitalistic company who do not want marijuana to be legal to safeguard their interests and drive THEIR profits specifically.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have facts backing my view.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Compare them to mainstream physicians who work at legitimate medical centers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Let me make this more clear.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of pot smokers get terrible grades in college, then decide they want to go to medical school.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They get their parents to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to a Caribbean, eastern European, or Asian medical school that has accepts anyone who pays.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They return to the wealthy developed country they were from (e.g., the US, Canada) and open a marijuana clinic where they hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars exploiting medical marijuana loopholes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Contrast that with students who get top grades in college, get scholarships to go to top medical schools in the US (or wherever they are from), are genuinely interested in research, and get jobs at top medical centers (e.g., Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Mayo).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some get MD's, some get PhDs, some get both.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These scientists are excited about doing medical research that will cure disease, and have millions of different options for what they think is promising and want to study.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Very few of them think marijuana represents a promising opportunity to cure disease.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medical marijuana is the same as any other alternative medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's no different than using acupuncture to cure AIDs or Reiki to cure cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If people want to smoke it because it's an entertaining intoxicating substance, that's great.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But considering it to be a cure-all for " chronic pain relief, seizure control, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Cancer, Crohn’s Disease, Glaucoma, Hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s Disease etc." is ludicrous.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Stoners who think weed acts as a bandaid for (some, not entirely sure about all of them, but pain, seizures, mental health problems (depending on the individual) are proven to help. they dont cure chronic pain, they are a pain killer to help chronic pain sufferers).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have NO idea what you are talking about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Mainstream doctors in major clinics and hospitals get federal funding and therefore makes it difficult (if not impossible) to conduct widespread research and legalized prescriptions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[The bureaucracy about receiving these federal funds is what makes SKILLED and WELL-EDUCATED doctors](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/07/11/cincinnati-hospitals-reluctantly-realize-medical-marijuana-coming-town/759044002/) (if you think that only the best doctors come from the western world you must be more ignorant than you come across) set up shop privately for research.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[There are marijuana drugs that are FDA-approved drugs based on research conducted by leaders in their field such as in Ohio.](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/06/27/cincinnati-test-site-weed-drug-fda-has-just-approved/732043002/)  Which goes back to my OP about the government bodies responsible for being a barrier for legalization or even rescheduling **even though the FDA** has already approved a marijuana drug!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				FYI cocaine is not even a schedule 1 drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you call it an alternative medicine?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How can they justify having cocaine as a schedule 2 substance and still have an FDA approved drug with a medical use for it listed as a schedule 1?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nobody is saying marijuana is a cure-for-all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You made that up.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not all drugs need to be cures.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medicine is not equal to a cure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medicine can be used to alleviate debilitating symptoms, such as in the example above.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You also refer to marijuana as an alternative medicine because that's what pharmaceutical companies over decades have insisted on calling anything else that isn't orthodox or doesn't come from their labs and has ultimately has a negative connotation of lacking efficacy, WHICH ISN'T TRUE!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whatever "boring science" (only 2 words I agree with you on)  being conducted by NDCP and NIDA is based on POLITICAL GREED of wanting to stay in office and being beholden to CAPITALISTIC self-interest lobbying groups including conservative and pharmaceutical and companies (see OP links) and their history of spreading lies and fear about the effects of marijuana.

medical marijuana				I don't think there are many people out there who are saying that recreational marijuana is great for everyone and has no downsides whatsoever.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The argument is merely that compared to other legal substances, such as alcohol or processed foods, marijuana is equally dangerous or less dangerous.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why it's being legalized in many states; it's really tough to justify alcohol being legal but not marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol is demonstrably more dangerous on every level.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm the exception to the "weed is good ".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now I'm basing my use in the past because of my anxiety and 90% of the time when I tried it, it made me worse and I just couldn't cope with it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				CBD oil , vape etc, wasn't to bad for me but it messed with my stomach and made me feel sick .	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree it does work for some people but not all people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The thing I hate about it is the people who think it cures cancer , depression etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It doesn't cure it , it can help afaik but it's not the be all and end all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also I drink a lot of alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have drunk driver in the past, I haven't gone near my motorbike in a year and 2 months because I'm trying to sort my head out and want to stop that .	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I will say though that , drunk driving and smoking a joint driving, for me anyways , smoking a joint driving is a hell of a lot worse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm with you, it doesn't agree with me either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pot always just makes me really anxious.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But while I don't personally enjoy it, it's not like smoking too much in one night could kill me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I could certainly die from alcohol poisoning, though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol's also much more likely to react dangerously with other drugs, and long-term overuse causes organ damage.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So even though I much prefer alcohol personally, I must concede that weed is less dangerous.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have a point, including the one regarding how everyone thinks it’s great dadada.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But, the pothead community can spread so many misconceptions smh	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean sure, people who really love pot will tell everyone in the room with them how it's the best thing ever and if they don't like it maybe they just haven't had the right strand yet or whatever.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When someone's a superfan of something (be it a substance, a music group, a film director, etc.), they're going to insist that it's amazing and that everyone should love it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Luckily most of these people eventually grow up and realize that their own experiences aren't universal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And in the meantime, we all know not to take them seriously.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A) You don't need to smoke it to get high lol, you're a bit outta your depth here.  B) relative to alcohol the downsides are non existent. Not a diet of water and rice.   C) 95%+ of people who use cannabis don't believe it cures cancer  If you're gonna drink you can smoke some reefer you'll be fine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Live a little	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah, there are vaporizers as well, I’m aware	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And you can just eat it	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That too, also using dab, wax, edibles.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				well - first off about half of the concerns you raise can be eliminated by not SMOKING the marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Had you said "smoking' it was bad, more of that would be true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But with vaporizers today the effects and benefits can still be had without some of the bad effects such as chronic bronchitis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(Full disclosure btw - i don't actually use dope but i live where it's 100 percent legal and did a crap tonne of research helping my dad  learn about it  for medical use. He uses it in consultation with his doctor).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Next - i think as you note most of the studies you mention agree that the nasty effects on the brain only occur in teens.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Their brains haven't fully developed yet and can suffer damage from regular dope use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However - once they hit that 19 mark or so dope doesn't affect people that way any more.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So - perhaps younger people should abstain but the medical problems aren't significant when you get older.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Third - it has been noted that dope contains a number of other chemicals that do a lot of good beyond just getting you high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All joking aside, used in moderation it IS a very good anti-stresser and has been found to help with mild depression and anxiety.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure - using it to control serious mental health issues would be a mistake and you should only use it for that purpose with the direction of your doctor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However - it has helped many people with mild cases in conjunction with other medical or mental health treatments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But - where it really shines is a long term pain relief product, especially for pain caused by inflammation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've heard again and again from many people but especially from my dad, that it seriously helps control his chronic pain from joint issues and allows him to sleep at nights pain free.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He had to quit due to chronic bronchitis but started up again with a vaporizer and he said it was night and day without it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So - if you're not using dope to do that, what's your other choice?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Every other drug you could use has far worse long term side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So I think you're glossing over some of the medical benefits as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're absolutely right to say that it's not 100 percent 'risk free', and teens and preg people should avoid it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But - I think honestly for those it's appropriate for it's actually UNDER appreciated, it can really help with a lot of problems that every day people face and it can do it far more safely than the alternatives.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And for recreational use - well that's a personal opinion of course but i think you'd have a hard time showing it was any worse than beer as far as health or addiction issues go.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just remember it would take 40000 joints in 15 minutes to kill you	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well thank god you caught me in time. :)	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Where as coffee will kill you at 70 cups	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Absolutely!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So view changed?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana doesn't have to be smoked and it's easy to see how the benefits outweigh the mild risks and cognitive impairment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We wouldn't have half of the great music that was produced in the twentieth century, or many of the developments in science and technology, just to name a few things that the cognitive benefits of marijuana made possible.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana gave us a counterculture that was able to end the Vietnam War.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Are you serious?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A war?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Better have this resources lmao.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I wouldn’t call those mild either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's well understood that marijuana was instrumental in eroding public support for that war.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you don't understand the contribution that marijuana makes to our culture you shouldn't kid yourself that you understand the cost benefit analysis that millions of perfectly rational potheads are making.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Water isn't as good as people think, 6 liters will kill you by causing your brain to swell leading to seizures then death, more deadly then cannabis which sits at 40000 joints in 15 minutes	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Oh my goodness...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, and for good reason.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Looking at any single substance you can make it look bad by talking about the theoretical side effects of prolonged or extreme exposure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The key is to look at it relative to other substances and realize that most anything is going to raise your risk factor for certain conditions later in life  Also, that Duke study was found to be more than slightly flawed.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Hmm, I'll look or more studies but it's not about looking at it relative to other substances and realizing that anything can give you risks, it's about the fact that marijuana compared to non drugs, is a psychoactive mind altering plant that is way more harmful than just consuming water	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Really?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				* Every person who has ever died at some point was exposed to water.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				* While most addictive substances gives you days to be injured You cab only go roughly 3 days without water before you die.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				* A mere 6 litres can kill you as opposed to 80lbs of pot	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hmmm, I will say you are correct in many ways.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No one had ever died from marijuana, unless you can count them being high while driving as a death sentence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They would not have died from the marijuana though.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They died from a lethal case of stupidity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Lmao true, but the marijuana made them have poor judgement memory loss or thoughts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But being stupid made them get behind the wheel while high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While the marijuana didn't help them in the situation,  being stupid ultimately put them there.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We don't blame a baby for being unable to fight off a dog, we blame the parent for leaving them unsupervised.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I suppose	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not really water can be psychoactive, considering that there have been many cases of peoples brains swelling causing seizures, to my knowledge to the point of me last checking no one has yet to actually die of cannabis from over consumption, where as water has killed many people just from drinking, then you also have drownings, but if you want a drug that's way more toxic then marijuana then just look at caffeine, kills at just 70 cups of coffee, also 48 teaspoons of salt within 5 min will kill you	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes you are correct but how is H2O itself exactly psychoactive?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes it causes those things but the chemical formula?	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				there are plenty of randomized controlled trials showing the efficacy of cannabis as an analgesic for chronic pain, an anti-emetic, and anticonvulsant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				much more than half the united states now recognizes the medical benefits of cannabis.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				so what group considers it ineffective, and why do you trust that group more than others that state the contrary?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>They say things like it’s not as bad as things like alcohol and tobacco cigarette but to me this just seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way  you’re committing the logical fallacy of false equivalence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				how is using cannabis in any way equivalent to using tobacco and alcohol, other than the fact that people use them?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				driving a car - and the effects of internal combustion engines in general - is significantly more dangerous than using cannabis.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				[Here's an old study](https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/news/20071214/study-shows-toxins-in-marijuana-smoke) from webMD, which may not be the most informative.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[Here's one](http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/marijuana-and-lung-health.html) from the American Lung Association, [and another](http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/marijuana-and-lung-health.html) that I found quickly by University Of Washington.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't really see how that is a false equivalence, both are abusable substances that people can and have gotten addicted to.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Neither of those three are any good for you and I was trying to use them as examples of other abused substances.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know this is off topic but I actually *do* think people shouldn't drive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm maybe blindly optimistic about autonomous vehicles and I think even the best drivers are shitty in reality.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anyway that's for a different thread but to me it's all reckless behaviour.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe what I'm really getting at is mental health, I spoke mostly about physical consequences earlier and I think that weed in no way helps with depression, anxiety or psychosis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I do recognize now that some studies are showing that it can be used to treat chronic pain and other conditions like you said but my gut instinct is just to go with the highest authority I would recognize which is the government stating it as a schedule 1 drug which implies no medical benefits.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe I'm misdirecting a bit and see more of a problem with people self-medicating to treat mental illnesses which is where I was thinking along the lines of no medical benefits which I can see may be not true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of those people I mentioned earlier, in fact most of them,  struggle with depression or anxiety or other things and while I think it's great if it helps you get through a hard time, relying on it to make you feel good is where I would draw a line and call it a problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone says they need to get drunk to have a good time they're an alcoholic but if someone smokes up to feel good everyone seems to think it's ok.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Establishing a causal link between cannabis and cancers will take decades of research.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There isn't enough information right now to say for certain whether cannabis poses the same risks as tobacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That does *not* mean, however, that we can just reason by analogy and be absolutely sure that cannabis and tobacco pose the same risk just because both are often smoked.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Note also that medical cannabis can and often is delivered orally - as a pill or in edible form - or via vapor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your sources themselves prove that the analogy between tobacco use and cannabis use isn't adequately established.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When possible, I'll present some quotes from the studies with their URLs so you can read them for yourself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				More than a few aren't available without payment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Here's an excerpt from the American Lung Association's [first source](https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR) in the list of studies regarding chemical composition and effects of cannabis smoke: >...habitual use of marijuana alone does not appear to lead to significant abnormalities in lung function...the accumulated weight of evidence implies far lower risks for pulmonary complications of even regular heavy use of marijuana compared with the grave pulmonary consequences of tobacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[The second](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx700275p) compares the chemical composition of cannabis smoke and tobacco smoke in identical smoking conditions and discusses the findings and limitations of existing studies on the topic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is actually the same source used by WebMD.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				WebMD reports - without further discussion - that cannabis has higher levels of toxins than tobacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The authors best explanation for this is that the cannabis used in the study was grown with a higher concentration of nitrate than the tobacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's unclear from this study whether these concentrations would change in different growing conditions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				WebMD fails to mention that tobacco contained higher amounts of other toxins, including formaldehyde and related compounds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Therefore, even though population-based studies have generally failed to show increased risks [of tobacco-related cancers from marijuana use], one cannot be entirely certain that some individuals (especially heavier marijuana users) may incur an elevated risk, although such risks appear to be small in relation to the well-known hazards of tobacco smoking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The third source is from *1975* - over 40 years old at this point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It would be nice to read it, but we're restricted to a preview that has no information about results or experimental methods.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[Here's](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-0823-2_3) the study.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[Fourth](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-0823-2_3) is another old study with a sample size of 15 people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While it found that cannabis smoke is associated with greater tar yields and carbon monoxide exposure, the study attributes this to differences in the smoking dynamics between tobacco and cannabis, namely >approximately two-thirds larger puff volume, a one-third greater depth of inhalation, and a fourfold longer breath-holding time with marijuana than with tobacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's unclear from this study whether the measured quantities would differ if identical smoking dynamics were used.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The [final](https://doi.org/10.1586/ers.10.87) source speaks to the frail analogy between the adverse effects of cannabis use, and the fatal and irreversible effects of tobacco use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that marijuana can impair lung function, damage large airway mucosa and possibly contribute to bullous disease, while its carcinogenic potential is controversial.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your last source is the same as the first.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You lack any evidence to adequately support your equivalence between the dangers of smoking tobacco and the dangers of smoking cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, appealing to authority is a logical fallacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just because the DEA schedules cannabis doesn’t mean it’s lacking in medicinal value.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As mentioned, cannabis is scheduled in the same category as heroin, and above methamphetamine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yet drugs that kill hundreds of thousands - directly and indirectly - you can buy at your gas station.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>my gut instinct is just to go with the highest authority I would recognize which is the government stating it as a schedule 1 drug which implies no medical benefits  I think you have little to no understanding of the actual scheduling of drugs or the political motivations behind it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				By this logic, you believe that marijuana is more dangerous that almost all opiates, cocaine, apl manner of amphetamines including *methamphetamine* and friggin PCP...all deadly when abused and all Schedule 2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[According to the NIH](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates), a government organization, opiates and their derivatives killed almost 60k people in 2017, meth about 11k, cocaine about 14.5k.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The NIH also estimates [88k alcohol related deaths per year](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol isn't even scheduled.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Guess how many times weed has killed someone due to use in all of human history.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you guessed any number higher than 0, you're wrong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> my gut instinct is just to go with the highest authority I would recognize which is the government stating it as a schedule 1 drug which implies no medical benefits   The government stating it as a schedule 1 drug is false and needs to be updated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As of this year there is a drug approved by the FDA which treats Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome and is mdae from CBD, a component extracted from cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Due to this, we are in need of it to be rescheduled as Schedule 1 implies, like you said, no medical benefit.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				I do agree that smoking marijuana is as bad as tobacco, but nicotine is highly addictive and causes people to smoke large quantities of it which is bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				TRUE and nicotine is very bad, but I think addiction is being seen more and more as a mental illness and not as simple as "addictive substances cause addiction".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think people get psychologically hooked in a similar fashion to how nicotine physically hooks you .Gambling for example is very dangerous if done chronically but obviously there are no chemical hooks in gambling except for like the dopamine rush I suppose lol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Exactly, all addiction is a form of dopamine rush.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nicotine does it chemically, and gambling does it through a physical reward.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana has no large dopamine rush.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana has a dopamine rush.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When THC attacks the endocannabinoid system it releases a lot of dopamine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some of these CB receptors are located in the nucleus accumbens which controls motivation and reward.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is why getting high feels good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>One of the main reasons I've been so torn up on this lately is that a lot of my friends (including my girlfriend) started smoking and have definitely changed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It bothers me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's a lot to unpack in your "main reason" and I don't want to pass too much judgment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You'd have to explain how your friends have "changed" in order to really get at the crux of your main argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The biggest issue is, I know these are your friends, but what is it that bothers you and why?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Others actions are their own.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It bothering you could be because it threatens your sense of control.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which would be more your issue than theirs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I could guess at how they've changed or why, but that would be problematic for an informed counter argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I see what you're saying, and maybe with my girlfriend there is an underlying sense of control that I just can't recognize for myself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One of my life long best friends started recreationally in high school and has progressed onto harder drugs like cocaine and acid and I barely talk to him anymore.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not because I don't want to but because most of his time is spent consuming drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Personally I don't like people when they're high as much as when they're sober in the same sense as how a lot of drunk people just annoy me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe that's my problem but the effects it has on people just seem to be off putting in general but maybe that's my opinion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm more concerned than bothered, that may have been poor word choice on my part.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I feel like when they started as minors, which is already concerning considering the effects drugs and alcohol have on developing brains, they seemed to preach it like there was no issue whatsoever to it without acknowledging consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like I said earlier a lot of the people I'm referring to suffer from mental illness as is and I think smoking to "relieve" their symptoms is a symptom of a larger mental illness.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At the end of the day, everyone will do what they want to do and I can't impact that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think my anxiety makes things worse than they are and makes me care more than I should but I love and care about my friends and significant other and hate to see them suffering or coping with unhealthy mechanisms.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're clearly an intelligent person.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would say that your main argument on why weed is bad for you is less about weed than other underlying issues.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>One of my life long best friends started recreationally in high school and has progressed onto harder drugs like cocaine and acid and I barely talk to him anymore.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not because I don't want to but because most of his time is spent consuming drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Personally I don't like people when they're high as much as when they're sober in the same sense as how a lot of drunk people just annoy me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Something I've realized over time is that people who are uncharismatic while inebriated often aren't as charismatic when they're sober as we may think.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You mention "life long best friends".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sometimes we take our relationship history and give it significant value over relationship compatibility.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We have innate sense of loyalty to people we've spent a lot of time with.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As we grow up, we spend time figuring out who we are, becoming more introspective, and deal with the mental anguish of coping with the outside world.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If your friends are dealing with mental issues, and using drugs, I would bet that they are avoiding personal growth.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would also assume they avoid these issues while sober too, just that drugs lower their inhibitions, and their immaturity is more apparent and they seem annoying.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've know a lot of addicts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some of which were the most selfish, intolerable assholes I've ever met.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some, are the nicest, most caring, empathetic, interesting people I've ever met.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The one thing is, they are always the same people sober, and drugs always amplify their true selves due to lowering inhibitions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You have to figure out how much of yourself you're willing to invest in these people and ask yourself if they are truly compatible with your personality, and how much loyalty you actually owe them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What you stated in your comment, seems like what you should be communicating to your friends.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's my 2 cents.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean you can do a lot of different thingd with weed you dont have to smoke it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes that's true and it will negate a lot of the negative effects of smoking as inhaling any kind of smoke, even from like a wood fire or something, is still bad for your lungs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think the effects of THC though are still an issue as they can induce all kinds of mental issues while posturing as a substance that makes you feel good and seems to have no consequences.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Totally agree with you in regard to smoking cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anytime you combust something and inhale smoke it’s bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That said vaping and edibles are much safer and there are very clear medical applications.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Undeniably helps some people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Without even comparing to tobacco and alcohol you can look at all kinds of things people ingest knowing full well that it’s are bad for them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sugar, salt, fatty foods etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s a trade off.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some level of pleasure in exchange for some negative effect on your long term health.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Personally I enjoy cannabis for relaxation but moved to a vaporizer years ago to minimize the health effects and would never go back to smoking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That said just like cigarettes some people make the choice to smoke and as long as they don’t affect me or my loved ones I live and let live.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you’re concerned for your friends maybe politely suggest a safer method of ingestion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is is just because weed is hip and trendy and cigarettes are old and gross?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no proof that it is equally bad.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is proof it has harm, but I'm not aware of any studies even testing it compared to cigarettes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Additionally what would you even consider "equally as bad"?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Say one joint is as bad as one cigarette, wouldn't that then mean a marijuana addiction is better for you than a tobacco addiction, as I've never seen someone smoke 40 joints a day but a 2 pack a day smoker is not that rare among smokers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits and I don't really see how it possibly could as current understanding of THC which is the strongest known cannabinoid in marijuana seems to cause more harm then good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can understand that CBD is being shown to be successful in treating things like chronic pain and anxiety however THC vastly outnumbers CBD in weed and smoking to get these effects seems counterproductive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact that its still considered to have no medical benefit is why it is so hard to say if weed is bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because we *know* it is not true that weed has no medical benefit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So clearly the drug has been severely understudied and we have very limited understanding of its benefits or harm.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are right that there are many studies coming out showing drawbacks, but you're ignoring the ones showing benefit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whether or not "weed is bad for you" really is unknown at this point as we just don't know enough about the benefits and how they weigh against the downsides.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One minor detail you might be unaware of is THC has a synergistic effect with CBD, increasing its potency.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>I feel as if medical marijuana companies are trying to piggyback off the false notion that it's a harmless drug and push it onto people asap similarly to how tobacco companies operated back in the day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They say things like it's not as bad as alcohol or tobacco cigarette but to me this seems like a logical fallacy as one could really justify any reckless behavior this way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't disagree, but that's just capitalism and nothing to do with if weed is bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is it really any different than the massive companies profiting off of our addiction to artificially sweetened foods and drinks?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd like to give you a few points to think about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tobacco, from a biological perspective, is more harmful than cannabis because of its main problem: cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There has been no correlation found between cancer and cannabis (at least according to the research I've done, feel free to inform me if I'm wrong about this) whereas cigarettes are the number one most common cause of cancer as I have learned in my genetics lectures in university.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Whether cannabis has significant health impacts is unsure, there is a correlation between cannabis and certain symptoms, however it is very very important to note that this does not mean causation and could correlate because of different reasons (e.g. people with those symptoms being more likely to pick up cannabis in the first place).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis can be addictive, but has a lower risk of addiction than alcohol and tabacco.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It also is a psychological addiction rather than a physiological addiction and if handled the right way, it isn't harmful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now you're completely correct in saying it isn't harmless, and this is where the true problem lies: People abusing it the same way alcohol and tabacco is abused.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I personally however believe that this lies vastly in the responsibility of the person who uses cannabis, rather than the cannabis itself.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In some cases, the risk of addiction is too high, but if we're setting alcohol as the limit of "something can be this addictive for us to leave it to the consumer to regulate themselves so they can handle it" then cannabis is definitely within this limit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The issue is the polarized thinking that I think is, at the end of the day, really what bothers you: That because it's less risky than other drugs, people think it's completely harmless and abuse it, when it really can pose harm too.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think we can find common ground here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis can be enjoyable to some people, but it is very important to use it responsibly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The harms cannabis can cause should, even when contrasted with alcohol and tobacco, not be undermined, and it shouldn't have a reputation as being "completely harmless".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Being careful not to grow dependent on cannabis is just as important as the importance of not growing dependent on any other drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know many people who use cannabis responsibly and don't grow dependent on it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's possible to just enjoy it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm sad to hear that people around you have started using it irresponsibly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a double edged sword.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I hope I gave you some insight.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I noticed you were linking this old webmd article to another person?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But why link a 2007 article over the newest one?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				\_ [https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/marijuana-lung-cancer-risk#1](https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/marijuana-lung-cancer-risk#1) \_ Although it does have similarity to the other article with cons.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It newly states that marijuana has never been proved to be linked to lung cancer, and that a link hasnt been found.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They say thats due to limited time for research.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because its illegal on a federal lvl research is hard to come by until recently.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It also states that in animal research there are things in marijuana that might actually **fight** tumor growth, but further research is needed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And people have actually used weed to help cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Which supposedly worked in this young child, that was given suppliments to try to fight cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would link this but im drunk and jus chillin and its gonna take awhile.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I dont think weed cures cancer, especially if you smoke it, but I think its possible that it did something to help this girl.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I personally only use a vaporizer, and drink very rarely.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Heres the part where I kinda support part of your argument, weed can be very addictive and is totally a gateway drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Although the other than weed and alcohol iv just tried xanax ones or twice.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				xanax is powerful, dangerous, not in a psychedelic way, but in a ruins your life and you forget everything tired depressed way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But ever since iv started smoking weed the habit only gets bigger, now its pretty much daily, every night before i go to sleep i always chill w/ a quick smoke, always vaporizing, which release no tar like smoking does.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It only heats the THC and CBD to a temperature where it is active, kinda what they do to make weed ready for edibles, before adding it to the mixture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are many studies showing that the smokes chemicals and tar excretion from vaporizing is significantly less from just regularly smoking weed like in a joint.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And when weed is smoked through a water pipe/bong some of the tar and carcinogens are removed through the water.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I digress, I kinda wish I never started smoking, its a nessesity that i spend a good amount of money on and that makes me happy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I want to do most things high, and pretty much always smoke if i got weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I always can get some so I always buy some.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I am noted as an extremely intelligent person, weird wording but me and all my siblings have gone to ivy league schools (Harvard, Standford etc..) I am not trying to flex, but because I started generally young, I feel that smoking weed has limited my potential.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think if I stopped for a long period of time, my great memory would come back, but come on did i ever have a great memory or do I just think i had a better one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sometimes I take a week break to reset tolerance a bit, or if i really need to focus on something, out of weed etc...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I always have the intention to start again in a week and always do.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its pretty much impossible to break the cycle because why the fuck would I break the cycle.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smoking weed is just, great sometimes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its not meth its not coke, but it can really let you appreciate life, especially music.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its not too late for me, I hope.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I dont fit in with stoners, or dealers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I fit in with smart sober people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When im sober.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When im high im just a responsible guy whos tryna smoke because everything fucking sucks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Im sorry for the rant, Im pretty sure iv been writing this for over around 45 minutes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What if this post was archived or some shit and I just wasted all that fucking time lmfaoooo please nooooo.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I wonder if any of this even makes sense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Dont start smoking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its not good for you, and in my opinion somehow extremely addictive, without being addictive at all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The analogy I always use is, Weeds like pizza (for pizza lovers), its good as fuck.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its not nicotine, or opiods.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It just tastes good, or feels good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And you kinda want it, when your sad, when your happy, when your bored, when your in a great mood.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pizza could just make life fucking great if we could eat it all the time without gaining weight.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well some people see the possibly negative effects because weight gain is visible but weed abuse isnt.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If I could eat pizza all day any day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I truly would cause that shit is great.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And although weed so far isnt a gateway drug for me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You'll start w it and move on to something else especially if its offered to you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Acid overall isnt horrible, it isnt addictive and most people take it to have a crazy trip **extremely rarely,** others take it every weekend, but that is the low 1% or less.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Coke, Meth, Heroin, Crack, are some of the worst most addictive terrible things in the word, they are pure man made chemicals, that fuck up your appearance (not really coke but the others yes), and are so extremely addictive that you literally NEED THEM.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				IMMEDIATLY.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While Molly (MDMA) and acid are on the safer side.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Xanax and alcohol are very similar to weed, alcohols more addictive and definetly impairs driving way more than weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But never drive with any drug in system.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Xanax is the most addictive and most dangerous.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its a legal prescribed medicine that you can overdose on (like every thing iv mentioned except weed) and it completely changes personality and destroys memory and emotions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I NEED TO STOP WRITING DAMN.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				goodnight bro.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I hope you read this, please argue w me	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yea I commented earlier under another post that I recognize that there are some studies and anecdotal evidence to support physical benefits to people with chronic pain and other conditions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree with not understanding why alcohol is more accepted either, the effects are known to be bad and people still use it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have been battling MDD and severe anxiety for most of my life and at least in my experience I feel even shittier after I smoke then when I drink.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's just how I felt.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The reason why I was comparing it to alcohol isn't that one is worse or better, I think both are shitty buy yes alcohol in my opinion is a more dangerous substance, but to state that treating mental illnesses with substances that are known to enhance mental illnesses or even cause them just doesn't make sense to me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe I just don't get it?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				or maybe there is more research to suggest otherwise but when I looked I found that most people would agree that marijuana can induce effects such as depression, anxiety, paranoia and long term use can accelerate development of psychosis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm glad it worked to treat your pain though, it's nice to hear that you were able to make a recovery.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nah I agree with you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Im a pot head myself and even I'll admit a lot of the "medical" benefits are a bunch of BS that other emotional pot heads come up with and try to push to rationalize there addiction.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm an addict difference is I'll admit it and I'm not ashamed of it, I'm grown I can do what I want.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I'm not gonna make a bunch of bs up about potential medical benefits of me changing the chemical composition of my brain 😂 that's ridiculous.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People just don't like admiring the truth.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And truth is people like to get hi, that's all the rationalization I need.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Other people need more to rationalize it to themselves so they come up with shit like "weed cures cancer"   Lies	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yea but if all it does is make someone "feel good" Then I could extend that logic to heroin, heroin makes people feel great that doesn't mean it has a "medical" benefit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My definition of medical benefit isn't something that only makes you feel good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think weed should be legal everywhere across the board so my answer is yes to your question.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think it should be illegal anywhere in anyway.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I just don't think It should fall under something like "medicine".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I view it as more of a hobby	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hmmm, I guess that makes sense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My biggest problem with people defining it in medical terms is that I feel like it distracts from the fact that we shouldn't have to explain our usage of it to begin with.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I feel like people are pushing it as "medicine" in the hopes to legalize it, when I feel like we are taking the wrong approach, the shit should never have been outlawed in the first place and our approach ( in my opinion ) should be more to the affect of "were adults we can smoke if we want to end of story." idk if I'm explaining myself well	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				https://youtu.be/PgDhsv5Jmmc  I was unaware of shit like this 👆🏻 that's nuts.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yea I would totally classify that as a form of medicine	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But we do use opiates to treat pain in a lot of these instances.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While I agree with you about most of what you said, the statement "weed cures cancer" does have some merit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabinoids have been shown to kill cancer cells in lab studies according to https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cannabis-pdq#link/_13	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				>Smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes  No, there are different sets of chemicals between the two smokes, and we know both that smoking marijuana habitually is less likely to lead to many fatal diseases than is smoking tobacco and that many of the chemicals specific to tobacco (including nicotine) are carcinogenic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There's no parity of effects here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Is is just because weed is hip and trendy and cigarettes are old and gross?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Medicinally it still is considered to have no medical benefits  Again, no.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Could you provide any evidence for this?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>At the end of the day these companies are profitable off addiction and they have ulterior motives when it comes to testing this stuff.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's not because of the harm marijuana does, though, that's because of the illegality of being direct about recreational use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They would have no involvement in a psychological addiction with no medical component if the laws allowed for it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>They claim it's fine but in my eyes it's the same as smoking as cigarette, at least in the physical sense,  Again, no.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>At the end of the day, smoking every once in a while won't kill you in the same way occasionally smoking a cig won't kill you, however I believe that having a dependency on anything is not healthy and weed is no exception.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Saying having a dependency on something isn't healthy is not the same as saying that thing is inherently bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's bad to stay dependent on your parents too long, but that doesn't mean your parents are bad for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would put it this way -- the toxicity of common drugs such as aspirin or tylenol is off the charts compared to ingesting the active ingredients in marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For your view to hold, shouldn't you also be against pretty much every pharmaceutical drug, as well as food in general?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				After all, many people eat food to dangerous levels, to major detriment to their health.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I feel like I already responded to a thread about this, but a few errors in the OP: medical marijuana is not a baggie of weed that the person rolls up and smokes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's either in vape oil or edibles, so the comparison to cigarettes is not valid regarding medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You aren't inhaling tar or CO with your marijuana when vaping or eating it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does not pose the same health risks as cigarettes when smoked this way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Obviously there are medical benefits to marijuana, acknowledged by many states now allowing doctors to prescribe it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not just for glaucoma and nausea.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It also helps chronic pain and epilepsy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is a range that people can choose, high in THC/low in CBD, about 50/50, and high in CBD/low in THC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You don't need to get high to use medical marijuana if you choose a high CBD level.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana as a treatment for chronic pain is definitely a safer route than opioids.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In fact, in some states, doctors can prescribe medical marijuana to help people kick their addictions to opioids, which is a strong statement in MM's favor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Any substance can be habit forming.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People claim addictions to food, to caffeine, even to things like porn or the internet.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana is not addictive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You don't get withdrawal sickness if you stop cold turkey.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It won't kill you to vape or eat it, you can't OD, and you won't die if you stop.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm sorry that the culture of your friend group has changed because they've started smoking pot.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is probably more about people making different life choices than the fault of the marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It depends on the person, I used to smoke every day before bed and I'm a GP and run my own clinic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm physically fit and run 2 miles under 20 min every day followed by my routine workout.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Enough bragging, but I really think if your friends are smoking pot and being lazy it's just that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They're smoking pot and being lazy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe you moved on in life faster than them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can after all, be all those shitty things your friends are and not smoke weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I’m not going to debate with you on the science of marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I’m going to say, if your friends are smoking weed and that bothers you, then one of you needs to change.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You either need to accept them and have their backs regardless of the difference in your opinions, or just distance yourself from them.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This research to try to convince them that weed is dangerous isn’t going to change their minds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was in your shoes before, my best friend started smoking in middle school after his older brother got him into the business.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In high school he got into heavier drugs and began to deal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He ended up getting expelled from high school because of it all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				After I got it into my head that I couldn’t change his mind, we got along much better.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				He knew I was clean and he wouldn’t push me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A few years ago he died from heroin overdose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I truly believe the biggest way that marijuana is dangerous is as a gateway drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It can really put you in with the wrong crowd.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I tend to agree with much of what you are saying: Cannabis, like many pleasurable indulgences is not healthy, particularly when taken to excess and most of the hype about its miracle-drug medicinal properties is nonsense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would like however to pick up on a couple of points:  Firstly you say: >   ...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smoke from burning marijuana is nearly equally as bad as tobacco cigarettes which society has agreed are bad for you so why does everyone pretend that this is ok?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think you need to bear in mind that a typical cigarette smoker might do ten to twenty per day while a typical cannabis smoker might do a few per week.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Dose is important.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If tobacco smokers only ever had one or two cigarettes with friends on the weekend, smoking would not be the public health issue that it is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Secondly, you need to consider the psycho-social benefits and alternatives.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If the occasional cannabis cigarette helps a person to relax and socialize, the benefits could easily outweigh the direct harm.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, if the realistic alternative is to use a more dangerous recreational drug (like alcohol), cannabis may be the healthy option.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd like to look at the studies that you're talking about specifically.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We can't really talk about these things unless we talk about it from a factual basis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Have you heard of the Charlotte's Web strain?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is clearly medicinal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are a few things here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Firstly, smoking anything is bad for your lungs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But cannabis smoke actually healthier than tobacco smoke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Have you seen or tried edibles?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Very different experience and much healthier.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Secondly, CBD has been proven to help pain relief and anxiety.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				THC is being studied for cancer treatments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				THC also helps with PTSD, especially with vets.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				CBD oil and some even use THC oil to treat ASD and ADHD.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				High dosage of cannabis can also help a lot hard drugs addicts quit and recover.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are more studies like this on more happening, you can also watch docos like Weediquette.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Here is when weed harmful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you have psychotic history in your family, cannabis may speed up the process.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you consume under age, up to 20 for some people, the brain is not developed fully yet so cannabis can affect on the brains long term if consume regularly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And because a lot of people spin tobacco when they have a joint, it can form a bad habit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Smoking weed just isn't good for you no matter how you cut it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Everything is relative.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A chemotherapy is not good for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But better than cancer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				An opioids aren't good for you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But better than dying from pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Weed has a wide palette of applications as painkiller, PTSD relief, helps with Muscle spasms, Seizures, and tons of other stuff, but without the addictive properties of opioids, or side effects of other drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Beyond dizziness, and hunger for cookies.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Everyday it seems I can find new studies that have more and more downsides to marijuana smoke in the short and long term and I just don't understand why people seem to think that there are no downsides here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Nobody is saying that weed is safe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Merely that weed is as safer or safer than current hard drugs that are legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Much safer than cigarettes or alcohol at least.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would argue that cannabis is safer than cigs; and most other drugs for that matter.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is impossible to overdose on it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree breathing in smoke isn't the best thing on your lungs; you can vape, eat or use a tincture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It does have medical benefits for some types of epilepsy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is defiantly not a cure all; and had a place after chemo for side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would argue for a responsible adult it is safer than alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have read studies that state it can effect a developing brain; so of you're a still developing it could be slightly harmful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Literally anything can be psychologically addicting.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol and caffeine are physically addicting.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think we need more studies on cannabis to fully understand it; bit that will be hard the way it is scheduled.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				1) In this country, we don't legalize treatments broadly as you propose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The FDA approves exclusively on a per-indication basis (eg for hypertension or lung cancer).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marinol and Dronabinol are both synthetic cannabinoids that are purely the active ingredient only approved for post-chemotherapy nausea.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana the plant as we know it has hundreds of substances in it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, it is almost impossible to see a future where marijuana as defined by the plant could be approved as a treatment (it's also not patentable). More realistically, you will see more companies attempt to formulate biologically active cannabinoids into brand name drugs so they can have usable intellectual property and make money. The value chain as we know it requires drug companies to find a patentable substance, put it thru trials, put it in front of the FDA, get approved for one disease at a time. There are no medical treatments without going this route and marijuana has issues at multiple points.   2) Regarding recreation, the adverse effects of marijuana use, especially long term use, are only starting to be elucidated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The burden of the evidence shows a pattern of decreased IQ/lifetime achievement in those who start younger.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, in those at risk of schizophrenia, the evidence continues to support marijuana use increases risk of psychosis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana dependence, while not as deadly, does develop in 9% of routine users.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These issues are well-explained in the attached citation (N Engl J Med 2014;370:2219-27.). For those outside the field, NEJM is considered among the world's leading medical journals.   3) I completely agree that barriers to clinical research on cannabinoids should be lowered.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's schedule I status is not motivated by good science or policy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree that cannabinoids have medical benefit in some areas, though not as broadly as the culture would have one believe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is unlikely that cannabinoids would match the pain relieving efficacy of opioids without significantly altering medical status or ability to function.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I agree, opioids are bad for many folks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Disclosure: am medical student, former pharma corporate strategy, here-and-there recreational user   EDIT: Thanks for a great discussion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For the record, these are not my personal opinions re: legalization/use but I've enjoyed engaging on the issues in an adult way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				&#8710; Having read through your original post again, it is relatively clear that it's going to be insanely difficult for the government to legalize and/or regulate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your CMV was it should be legal, not it would be difficult.  His first point was the industry cares more about money that the effects.  Marinol and all other synthetic marijuana pills take longer to start working and work for less time and often less efficiency.  But who cares, someone has to patent and make money of medicine!  > 2) The burden of the evidence shows a pattern of decreased IQ/lifetime achievement in those who start younger.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Studies are proving this to be false.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Also, in those at risk of schizophrenia, the evidence continues to support marijuana use increases risk of psychosis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also false, see my other comment below for links.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It MAY increase initial psychosis in people who are already at risk to develop schizophrenia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Marijuana dependence, while not as deadly, does develop in 9% of routine users.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is dependence in absolutely everything from the internet to sugar to video games and TV.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This has to do with people, no marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> It is unlikely that cannabinoids would match the pain relieving efficacy of opioids without significantly altering medical status or ability to function.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Is it unlikely?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cannabis SAVED my life, and the lives of many people I know.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiods are addicting and there is a heavy risk of addiction in my family.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I cannot tolerate NASAIDS, I can only use tylenol sparingly (liver issues).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I couldn't function without it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				After surgery my previous cannabis usage has not been an issue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(And I'm saving so much money!)  This is a weird statement to make, the poster has made a conclusion that has no proof or back up.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I didn't say that my mind was changed but he made me realize some things I had not thought of, hence the delta.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> I didn't say that my mind was changed  So ...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				no delta should be awarded.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I swear every mildly interesting topic on here nowadays says "[∆(s) from OP]" but it turns out to be bullshit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This delta has been rejected.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can't award OP a delta.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Allowing this would wrongly suggest that you can post here with the aim of convincing others.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you were explaining when/how to award a delta, please use a reddit quote for the symbol next time.	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Which do you think is more likely to cause a pattern of decreased lifetime achievement:  1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smoking pot  2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Going to jail for possessing pot and spending the rest of your life labelled as a felon for having some plant in your pocket  Marijuana is a drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It has dangers associated with it's use sure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				so does alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, like alcohol prohibition is far more damaging to society as a whole than use of the drug ever could be (because people are still using it regardless of the law).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Health effects and medical mumbo jumbo aside, the negative societal impact of marijuana prohibition should be reason enough to remove the schedule 1 label it has been so irresponsibly given.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You bring up a good point around criminal justice reform, though your explanation might not reflect the current reality.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think any states have possession of an amount of weed that fits in your pocket as a felony.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree that the schedule I status is not based on sound policy or the health reality	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				AZ, any amount of marijuana is a felony.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In Florida possession of less than one ounce of marijuana could get a person a $5,000 fine and a maximum of five years in prison.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cultivation of marijuana plants in Louisiana carries a mandatory five year sentence with a maximum of 30 years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That means a person could potentially get 30 years in Louisiana prison and a $50,000 fine for one plant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Will Foster is a rheumatoid arthritis patient who was convicted of marijuana cultivation and received a sentence of 93 years in prison; it was later reduced to 20 years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				After being paroled, Foster moved to California and registered as a medical marijuana patient.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then in 2009, Oklahoma decided they didn't like this and extradited Foster back to serve additional prison time.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A possession charge in Texas, even first offense, could carry a six-month jail sentence and $2,000 fine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just to reiterate this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In AZ, Cannabis is considered a narcotic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				2.5 grams to 2 lbs is the same charge.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A felony.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Oftentimes a judge will take it down to the highest level of misdemeanor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I got caught passing through AZ with a jar that i was making some vegetablr glycerin tincture in.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They charged me with manufacturing a narcotic.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Ya know.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A meth charge.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As well as 7 other trumped up felonies my expensive lawyer got dismissed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Had i not been able to afford that lawyer, it would have been 4 years in prison.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I admit that the AZ point is a good one, but it is not representative of our country more broadly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cultivation is a separate issue entirely to our discussion, as it has a baked-in assumption (rightly or wrongly) that the person intends to sell/distribute.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even if it were legalized, it would not become much easier to grow, since there would be more stringent regulations	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually, AZ is one of the only states that IS representative of the federal legislation against marijuana in this country.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The fact that 26 states have chosen to thumb their nose at the federal government on this issue is just another point in favor of a federal reclassification.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So then what's your point?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should it be legalized because the penalties are severe?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You've certainly made a compelling argument that the penalties are draconian, but how does that get you to legalization over decreased penalties?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It should be legalized because the damage caused by prohibition is demonstrably worse than the damage caused by regulation and legal use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prohibition has been a completely ineffective campaign.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People are going to smoke pot no matter what, just like it turned out that people were going to drink no matter what.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When alcohol was prohibited it created a black market that lead to money that used to be circulated as a regular part of the business economy going instead into the pockets of violent gangs and cartels.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sound familiar?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should people's use of marijuana (that prohibition of failed miserably at preventing) fund violent gangs instead of our education system?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should money continue to be wasted by our law enforcement agencies on prohibition that could better be spent on things like preventing terror attacks and mass shootings?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're honestly just advocating for alcohol being made illegal again more than making pot legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not even close, read again...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol prohibition lead to one of the darkest times in this country.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The exact same thing is happening with marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prohibition is ineffective and harmful.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Alcohol prohibition lead to one of the darkest times in this country.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think many would agree with that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> The exact same thing is happening with marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not really, no.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Prohibition is ineffective and harmful  Many can disagree.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prohibition can be seen to [reduce the rate of cirrohosis](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9681.pdf) at the time, indicating that it did indeed reduce excessive alcohol consumption.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can arguably still see the effects today.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[Alcohol consumption was WAY higher before prohibition and consumption has never reached that high since.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470475/) Prohibition can be seen as not necessarily a failure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If prohibition was not seen as a failed policy why was it rescinded?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				edit: This data seems to be directly on conflict with the data you provided:   https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance98/cons12.htm  The only category that shows less consumption than pre-prohibition is wine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Though consumption of all alcoholic beverages seems to be on the decrease since the 70's.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				figure 1 shows that overall consumption has NEVER dropped to below pre-prohibition era levels.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because it had succeeded reducing alcohol consumption and changing US attitudes surrounding drinking, thus making prohibition unnecessary	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is patently false as supported by the data I posted.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				After prohibition alcohol consumption peaked at an all time high in the 70's and has begun to decline since then.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Hoewever, even today per capita consumption is nearly double what it was pre-prohibition.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The reason they rescinded prohibition was actually that it lead to the formation of violent cartels that caused more of a risk to the public than alcohol did.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It had done NOTHING to change people's consumption habits or attitudes towards alcohol and I'm not sure what you may have heard or read that would have you thinking that way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prohibition did not reduce alcohol consumption, it just made criminals out of otherwise law abiding citizens.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The main reason is hidden in your #1 - because drug companies can’t make money on it, because things like cancer treatment really should be all about profit, right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's obviously not what they're saying.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They're saying is logistically impossible for marijuana as a plant to be passed by the FDA as a medicine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's not to say it's not effective or that it should be illegal to use it if you have certain health problems (or otherwise, I agree with legalisation), just that it can't actually be passed as a medicine which is why medical cannabis is a tricky one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I understand there's a fair bit of cynicism built into that comment but unfortunately the answer to your question is yes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The cost of developing a drug in this country is >$1B/drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Trials are massively expensive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, companies need to feel like they will get a return on investment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are no nonprofit entities or academic entities that have the capital or expertise to move thru the full drug development life cycle and market a drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you know why the US gets every breakthrough drug first?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because the pharma companies are based here and do their research and get approved here.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The financial upside is far better here than any other country.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While I agree that drug prices are outlandish and victimizing to consumers, we are complicit in it when we demand the newest and shiniest drugs when we get sick.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I can provide more concrete comparisons but that's the high level takeaway.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Isn't much of the scientific research that leads that leads to new drugs  funded by the National Institutes of Health via federal grants?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Wouldn't much of this be funded by taxpayer dollars before the drug manufacturer takes over?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unfortunately, it's seldom that simple.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				True, much of drug discovery does happen in academic settings.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But then again, some happens inside companies.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, how drugs go from preclinical candidates to clinical trials is very complex.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Some academics spin out companies of their own that get bought/licensed by pharma.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sometimes pharma just buys the rights outright.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pharma always ends up paying for the drug, it's not like they just take it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They make far more bad bets than good ones, which is inherent to the randomness of biology.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Do you know why the US gets every breakthrough drug first?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You what?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's hard to cite strong articles when people aren't allowed to study it properly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Agree completely - there is a massive dearth of research in this area that is stymied by scheduling from a lifetime ago.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is the first step to a really nuanced discussion about this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				1) Why does it need to be a meta analysis? You're absolutely right that it's not a practice-changing article. However, it does provide a helpful, brief summary of the state of the relatively nascent evidence. I believe this is the start of a building pile of evidence against marijuana. Quite frankly, I have yet to see much evidence in this thread against the thesis I've put forward.   2) This is a do-no-harm issue. If marijuana has any inkling of harm, how can the medical community be in favor of a recreational drug? The penalties can and should be softened, but why do we need another legal vice? Past examples for legalizing vices represent a mistake for me, not precedent.   3) You're right, the evidence is weak at best.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would agree the jury is out on this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But does it really pass the sniff test that cannabinoids would be as useful for pain as pop culture thinks?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These do not represent my personal opinions, I'm just really enjoying arguing through the issues with people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Thanks for chiming in!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				1) You're right, there is some risk of sample bias built into using a nonsystematic review. It's a great point to mention and serves to highlight the dearth of quality research here. I am essentially baking in a level of trust in NEJM that they would put forward a sound article but there may be errors in that assumption  2) I know that PNN is directed at us, I don't see how I obfuscated that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				By endorsing a drug for recreational use that has not-insignificant risks, how am I as a provider not doing harm?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't tell patients to drink more - just the opposite.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's not paternalism, it's just risk aversion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, with regard to criminalizing, I've addressed this in other comments - how does that get us over the legalization line?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				it gets me to vastly lower penalties, but it doesn't convince me there's a need to legalize.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Legal weed would create opportunities for regulation and control, sure, but I'm unconvinced that the black market/gangs would cease to exist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They could just undercut the prices given that they have such lower costs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The end user wouldn't care, since possession is legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Separate issue: Why shouldn't we advocate for the prohibition of cigarettes?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Granted it'd never happen with the tobacco companies such as they are.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is getting to the point where we're just exchanging views on the scope and approach of medical practice.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You've raised some really valid points.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For me, I came out of the drug industry and it left me with a firmly held belief in strict laws.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're right that we're not banning alcohol anytime soon but we have different beliefs on how medicine should intervene on a societal level.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I do like to points you put forward and as I continue to do my own research, I'll use some of your arguments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As far as CMV, I don't think that was your intent haha.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my opinion, you've put forward facts that only say why it will be interesting to see how the government and nation progress towards legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not sure I agree - I think it's relatively clear based on my argument that it's essentially impossible for marijuana to be completely legalized as a medicine as well as the increasing burden of evidence that recreation is not as safe as once thought.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would agree with you about your medicine argument given the amount of variance in the plant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do you think lab-grown plants that meet certain specifications are going to change this at all?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Can you elaborate about your recreational point?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree that there is more evidence that consuming MJ may not be as "safe" as once thought.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Surely there are similar notions to alcohol and tobacco?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				More research leads to more understanding but I would wager people aren't trying to outlaw booze even though it's generally not "helping" anyone in a broad sense.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm just not sold on why this particular argument should sway anyone to legitimize it being illegal, unless they're particularly fond of government regulation in regards to people's choices (of which I am not).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well he addressed all your points and poked holes in just about all of them, so I think a CMV was his intent, just not a 180 'nvmnd, marijuana should be illegal forever' CMV.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Agree that criminal justice reform is a major unmet need but I completely disagree with the gist of your point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How does getting caught make something worth decriminalizing?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You could also just not smoke weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Penalties might be too harsh but that doesn't inherently make it worth legalizing	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				People have been thieves since ancient times as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just because a group of people cause to do an act does not justify a change in its legal status.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't disagree with legalisation, but this isn't a valid argument unless you also agree that countless other crimes (ranging from theft to fraud to rape and murder) would also need to be legalised because people have been doing them since ancient times.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, but unlike your speeding example no one (except potentially you) is getting harmed by marijuana use.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In fact, you could argue that more people get hurt by the current laws because now criminals are the ones raking in the gigantic profits from the drug trade, which can then be used in more malicious ways.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also the decrease in IQ is only 3 points, which if you're familiar with statistics, is statistically insignificant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder shouldn't be smoking weed recreationally, but they do it now, often with no warning if they don't communicate their use to their doctor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Legalizing it, getting rid of street dealers, and educating dispensaries and our nation's children about the possible dangers of recreational use would make it safer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				An interesting point but I disagree with how you've put it forward.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The studies show a *statistically* significant (ie not likely to be chance) decrease in IQ that is dose dependent.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, it is debatable, as you say, whether it is truly *clinically* significant to a person.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Can you cite your source for the 3 points?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That would imply that there isn't a dose-response relationship, which is not supported by the following PNAS 2012 article (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				2012 Oct 2; 109(40): E2657–E2664.).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Heavy use before age 21 is associated with impaired cognitive development.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why would we want to make this any more pervasive than it is?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Comparing it to alcohol- even though the drinking age is 21, access is very easy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just playing devil's advocate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The negative effects of marijuana are no reason to keep it illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People destroy their lives with cigarettes, alcohol, hamburgers, internet porn, online shopping, gambling, etc etc etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should weed be illegal when these things aren't and are much more destructive and dangerous?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As an alternative, why legalize yet another vice?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Restrictions for what you've cited are only getting tighter, not looser.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				See huge cigarette taxes, banning trans fats, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Only the first three you've mentioned have relevant, causal health effects on the same scale as a drug like cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The medical establishment will not support legalization en masse as the harm becomes more apparent	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because studies have shown marijuana can help alcoholics and other types of addicts get over their addictions.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No one has ever had a physical dependence on weed or overdosed on it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is certainly the safest vice there is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Life is short and pretty frustrating; I don't see why I shouldn't have the right to smoke a plant if I want to.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And what harm, exactly?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like I said, no one has ever died from it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can die from alcohol, cigarettes, pills you can buy over the counter, eating too much, driving a car, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What are these dangers we need to be protected from?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your physical dependence comment is blatantly in the face of the medical evidence and the burden is on you to support that huge claim with some amount of evidence.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"and what harm" is discussed in the article I cited.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Agree that it's not the worst vice in the world, but why should we enable people to have yet another vice?	NoArgument	test

medical marijuana				Or crack?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or cigarettes?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, public health matters, but my point is that other far more unhealthy things are illegal, so why do you draw a line with pot, when it's proven to be safer than all these other vices?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As far as why it's a right, I think that's fucking obvious.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We have rights to eat the animals of the land, use the earth's resources to build things, we fish, we use the land to grow food.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why can't I smoke a plant that naturally grows out of the ground?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				An act that only effects me?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm not hurting anyone by smoking some weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should it be illegal??	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a total infringement on rights.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You think it's a good thing that people spend their lives in prison for having a plant in their possession?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To your second point.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why treat marijuana different than other recreational drugs?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Coffee increases anxiety in those prone to already, which could lead to a severely deteriorated quality of life and possible irrational behavior.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alcohol makes ppl with a tendency towards violence become even more unpredictable, not to mention the very serious health consequences and drunk driving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why do we treat marijuana differently?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Awareness campaigns and active enforcement of laws preventing or at least attempting to prevent young adults from using would apply here just like they did with tobacco, and now fewer and fewer ppl smoke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well, actually you stated the main reason it'll never be recreational- it can't be patented. How do you allow something to be legal when you have absolutely no way of controling it because it can literally grow anywhere? "I can't tax this, it grows like a weed."  Also, the long term effects cannot be known at this point in time because it hasn't been that long since a few states have legalized it and therefore are tracking it medicinally. That takes decades worth of knowledge, not the quick assumption that if you tell someone something is bad for them they won't do it. Besides, people are still vaping, even though they are literally test subjects to something brand new. At least marijuana has been around for a long time.  The problem with marijuana being connected to psychosis and schizophrenia is that 1) since it is illegal paranoia is a real thing that could escalate quickly in bad situations and 2) those labelled with such diseases of the mind could have history with it, or could have been activated due to some other psychosis that they failed to mention (psilocybin or lysergic acid).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are right, it will most likely become legal in pill form.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But as someone who doesn't like prescriptions, you won't find me signing up for government regulated bullshit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Regarding recreation I thought there are still conflicting studies about the IQ decrease showing the data is not absolute.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also with schizophrenia I thought it only increases chance of become schizophrenia, not make the psychosis  worse?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know people with schizophrenia that use marijuana medically.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also - the pills are not nearly effective as the natural drug and you get desensitized to the effects much faster making them useless.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd love to respond to this but it'd be great if you could cite sources re: the pills and schizophrenia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pills - personal use and conversations with doctors and other patients.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Schizophrenia: This study ["adds further weight to the theory that cannabis increases the risk of developing schizophrenia in individuals who are particularly susceptible."](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317170.php)  1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's just a theory, unproven 2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It effects only those who are already at risk of psychosis and in adolescence  [Cannabis high in CBD significantly lowered the degree of psychotic symptoms.](http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964(11)00224-6/fulltext)  [Cannabidiol enhances anandamide signaling and alleviates psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3316151/)  edit: I suck at links...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At this point it seems to me that marijuana is on its way to becoming legal honestly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s just gonna take some time to see what regulations and such will need to be in place.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				States like Colorado are basically guinea pig states and once enough elected officials see what kind of issues come from Colorado, they’ll start to transition it to the rest of he states.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s going to take some time but I definitely see the views around the states changing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s just a matter of convincing the older generations that have been against it for a while now.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				is your argument this:  A.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana and opiates treat pain.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				B.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates are bad.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				C.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, Marijuana is good.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well, basically yes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The opiate example was just a current issue in the US and I thought that would serve as a reference for what cannabis could be used for.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I believe cannabis and its parts have other various uses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You realize that is an invalid argument....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cats and Dogs are pets  Dogs are big  Therefore, cats are small.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cats are small and opiates are more addictive and potentially life threatening than marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tigers are not small.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maine coons aren't either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I guess I should clarify my argument further.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The choice between cannabis and opiates is a choice of the lesser of two evils in some peoples minds.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My argument is that it is an easy choice between the two.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But there are a million choices other then MJ and Opiates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tylenol, IBprofin, Motrin, etc etc etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why choose MJ?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's simply another option.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A very small set of people are allergic to certain types of painkillers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The very most basic point I think I'm trying to make is that marijuana/cannabis has no reason to be a Schedule 1 drug and it can immense impacts on society.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				have you ever wondered why there is an r/trees and not an r/nsaids?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				MJ is a painkiller with a weird cult like following (not to say addictive, but something weirdly like addiction).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				NSAIDs and other non-opioid pain killers treat pain and thats it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I do agree with you.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The "community" that has formed around cannabis can be quite odd to say the least.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But that should not detract from the benefits of it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And yes, NSAIDs are usually very effective.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would only like for cannabis to be an option when choosing medications.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I would like to admit that I suffer from a condition in where I cannot take but very limited amounts of acetaminophen and no other painkillers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I am simply trying to advocate for people that have very few other options.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The big problem with MJ is that is has the possibility to induce a euphoric effect and this is why it should be highly controlled as a substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				States where medical MJ are legal create the equivalent of pill mills where doctors have you pick from a list of conditions, diagnos you right there and without trying any other treatments provide you anMJ prescription.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then the places that fill those prescriptions aren't treated like pharmacies, rather like ice cream stores with different blends available and brownie flavor of the day.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Prescription MJ is a charade.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its a joke of a system.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What they should is work on engineering that euphoric effect out of the THC so that it can be used in a pill form with a manufactured generic that a standard pharmacy will carry and people won't just take it so it is fun.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That being said.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree MJ should be legal, it is basically equivalent to alcohol in the harm that it causes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I just think the, "medical," argument is bullshit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> The big problem with MJ is that is has the possibility to induce a euphoric effect  What's wrong with euphoria?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Second question: Have you ever smoked pot.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> I agree MJ should be legal  So far so good  > is basically equivalent to alcohol in the harm that it causes  Hold up.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know you're just expressing an opinion, but this is quantifiably not true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you compare the toxicity of alcohol to that of marijuana, [it's not even close.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311234/).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To overdose on pot, you would have to smoke in a closed room for a day straight almost.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To die from alcohol poisoning, you just have to down a few shots in a short amount of time, which is why alcohol poisoning is a leading cause of death in the US.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(88,000 die annually).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So just say you support legalization and leave it at that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You're further perpetuating the myth that pot is harmful when all evidence shows that it is not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It has lower toxicity than many over-the-counter medications even.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> engineering that euphoric effect out of the THC  That's not how chemistry works lol  Why would you even want that?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Let people have fun.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Besides, CBD is the more relevant component of medical weed and it doesn't get u high	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree with almost everything you said, and I really like your clear thinking.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However if MJ is as harmful as alcohol, how is that an argument to legalise another toxic substance?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Make alcohol illegal and ban toxic substances, rather than add another to the list (not that I want alcohol to be banned, just a point of argument)	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I mean they do already have cbd pills that have the psychoactive effects taken out for people who do not like getting high but like the medicinal benefits of it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For a lot of people, they like getting high and enjoy the medical parts of it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also strains produce different effects so that's why its an "ice cream shop."	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well, CBD is already is use for some of the mild treatment effects of cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They have pill forms already lol	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I wonder if you have ever been sick for years without any relief.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then you are shown this drug that helps you lead a normal life, even though you'e tried millions of other drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then they make you fight for it, even though it has less side effects than the other drugs they have been throwing at you in bulk.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Then people tell you how it should be made illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All of a sudden you have to fight with everyone to convince them you are in pain and not a drug addict even though they were fine when you were on morphine...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				All of a sudden you join a community because there are people who know what being demonized because you are in pain feels like.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why there is such a strong community.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So, just a heads up.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I went to UC Santa Cruz.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've smoked weed...a lot...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				and I 100% think it should be legal (I also think opiates should be recreational legal, just not drug cartel opiates).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My only qualm is with the, "there is so much medical need, weed is a medicine, it should be totally legal man!" There are much much better arguments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> That's why there is such a strong community.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is not why there is a strong community.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Weed became popularized during the summer of love in the late 60s.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It was a part of the counter-culture.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Possibly even earlier by the beatniks.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This wasn't some medical awakening it was a chance to rebel against shitty social/political conformity.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Furthermore, you got subs like r/trees which while they do have some medical content also is full of memes about 6ft bong rips.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Subs like r/cancer and r/fuckcancer even, don't have memes about that sick chemo treatment yo!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The "medicinal argumet" for the legalization of CBD is very compelling.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I didn't know anything about that substance till today!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				TIL!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The "sick chemo treatment" is poisoning them and though it's supposed to save their lives it makes them feel like shit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Weed instantly gives people back their lives.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You are speaking so forcefully about a topic you self-admittedly know basically nothing about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just a heads up, I have been sick for 13 years not being able to do much more than cry in bed, until I found weed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In that 13 years I have told doctors and parents and grand parents armed with more medical research studies than my doctor had ever found.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It took years to get a federal license (Canada), and it should have been given to me like the morphine was.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There are practically NO side effects on a drug that treats more illnesses than I could possibly list.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				(yes TREATS.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				IT caused remission in over half of patients with the disease I have (Crohn's))  I don't think opiates should be legal recreationally because they hurt people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>My only qualm is with the, "there is so much medical need, weed is a medicine, it should be totally legal man!" There are much much better arguments.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How about the argument of "it should never have been made illegal in the first place"?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is literally no reason for it to have been aside from racism and propaganda.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates are only prescribed for pain that is worse than what Tylenol and ibuprofen can alleviate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most people who are prescribed opiates have chronic pain conditions and can end up using them for many years despite clear indications that patients can become dependant within weeks and need to be weaned off, and most long term users had moderate to severe bowel problems, among other side effects.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd rather a small capsule of cannibinoids that isn't addictive, won't make me high and will keep my pain at a manageable level so I can live a normal life.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah, I didn't know about CBD till this thread.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				TIL!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The "medicinal argument" for CBD is clearly legitimate.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is basically another version of tylenol as far as my googling has shown.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				None of your options include nausea relief or increase of appetite.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is more than one problem in the world.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not the original person you were talking to, but I could give you my experience.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I have a genetic chronic pain condition.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It will only get worse over my lifetime.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Normal treatment for my condition includes pain control, usually a maintenance prescription of opiates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My mother, for example, has the same condition and has been on regular doses of opiates since she was *sixteen* (she's now in her sixties).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The pain itself never goes away.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It can range from mildly annoying to 'so severe you're screaming and can't get out of bed'.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't like to take opiates so I avoid doing so unless I'm close to that worst case scenario, and then I only take them for as long as needed to get through that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You suggest Tylenol, Motrin, Ibuprophen etc and on the top those *seem* like good alternatives, but there are consequences to long term use of those OTC pain relievers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Again, take me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not liking to use opiates and still working a full time job, I relied on regular doses of ibuprophen as my maintenance medication for pain, with occasional muscle relaxers for my worst days.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				First, you build up a tolerance to the ibuprophen, which necessitates taking higher doses to get relief.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I was moderating this but at my worst I was taking eight pills of over the counter ibuprophen a day, for a little less than two years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I suddenly started getting strange dizziness that was so severe my doctor thought I was having seizures.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Seizures were ruled out but it turned out my blood pressure was skyrocketing to dangerous levels.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A few more tests, and my doctor sat me down and gave it to me straight.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She said that I was starting to show kidney and liver damage and despite taking (by that point) medication to lower my blood pressure my blood pressure was still to dangerous levels and my heart (I have a mild tachycardia) was starting to get strained.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She said it very simply:  I could continue to take the OTC pain medication (Ibuprophen, Tylenol, whatever else) and I would be dead in five to ten years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Either of a heart attack or stroke, or liver and kidney failure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I could switch to an opiate pain medication as maintenance instead, with much the same side effects including the risk of addiction, and still be dead in five to ten years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I could stop all medication and be unable to work in one year and dead in two (from suicide from the unmitigated pain; suicide is the most common cause of death in people with my condition- the pain is that bad and constant).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Or, I could try an alternative.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				She suggested medical marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I had never done marijuana before in my life.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now it's about seven years later.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I use the medical marijuana on my bad days and have drastically reduced my OTC usage (from eight pills plus a day to now two pills, once or twice a week).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My blood pressure is spot on, there's no more sign of liver or kidney damage, my heart is back as it should be, and I have a full life expectancy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				THAT is why people choose MJ.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At least why I did, and other people I know have.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				OTC medications like tylenol and advil are all well and good but never fool yourself into thinking that because they are OTC they are *safe*.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They certainly aren't, especially if you need to take them as a regimen and not just on occasion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They nearly killed me.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				MJ saved my life.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I appreciate you sharing your story.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is very moving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree, you should be able to get CBD from your local CVS.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My point i'm making to OP is a very subtle one.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree with their conclusion, pot should be recreationally legal and you should be able to get CBD at CVS.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What I disagree with, is an argument commonly made, and OP makes it, is that because of medicinal purposes pot should be recreationally legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is intellectual misdirection.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>I agree, you should be able to get CBD from your local CVS.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd rather get it from my local recreational growers which also have a supply of MMJ.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'd far rather support independent farmers than a pharmacy and a patent, personally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pot legal recreationally in my state has made it far easier to do that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is a separate discussion then the one OP and I were having.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>  I'd far rather support independent farmers than a pharmacy and a patent, personally.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The access/local business argument is interesting.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Are there other analogues to this idea of medicine being manufactured AND sold by small businesses?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The only one that strikes me off the top of my head is opiates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Supporting the dealer on the corner is a small business as well?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm in favor of small business pharmacies, they unfortunately don't exist much anymore.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think production of a drug should be heavily regulated to ensure quality control and maximum medical benefit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				On the topic of small businesses, are you afraid that if MJ becomes legal in the US that that the cigarette companies are going to wipe out all the small growers almost instantly?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They already have massive distribution and production ability.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If it becomes legal, they will be in every gas station, bottle shop, and hookah bar as soon as they can grow their first crop.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They will be able to make it a loss-leader without hurting their bottom line long enough to choke every mom and pop grower out of the industry.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Seems like a disturbing proposition?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>The only one that strikes me off the top of my head is opiates.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Supporting the dealer on the corner is a small business as well?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No, of course not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because that dealer on the corner is illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I'm talking about *legal* recreational marijuana, with licensed growers and sellers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They are legitimate LEGAL small businesses, and I'd rather support them than Pharma.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unfortunately for most/all other medication out there, you have no choice to get them from Pharma.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>On the topic of small businesses, are you afraid that if MJ becomes legal in the US that that the cigarette companies are going to wipe out all the small growers almost instantly?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Not particularly, no.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Because I think legality will come more the same as it has already-state by state rather than in one fell swoop (there might be a final swoop at the end where a couple of the outlying states are made legal in the same bit of legislation that ultimately makes it legal federally).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't know about you but in the states where it has been made legal the tobacco companies have not really put shut to the marijuana businesses.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Though it would honestly surprise me if the tobacco companies *don't* start selling marijuana as well.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>Seems like a disturbing proposition?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sure, possibly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But Mom and Pop stores being choked out by corporations is a reality that extends far past this one product.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And in countries where marijuana is legal and has been for some time, this hasn't really happened as far as I'm aware.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates aren't bad.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unless you wanna kiss goodbye to pain reduction and palliative care, for example.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They've been part of humanity's medical materials forever.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Synthetic opiates being doled out freely by bent doctors is the problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually, yes and no.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates are bad in the sense that coccaine is bad: it's been concentrated down into a form that is much more powerful than the original source.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Chewing on a poppy flower or a cacao leaf is a much more natural way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, killing your pain isn't the greatest idea.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pain has to originate from somewhere, we don't just "hurt".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Got shoulder pain?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well, it's probably displaced and the muscles around it are pulling it further out.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's a matter of chiropractic work to pop it back in plus months of stretching to get it to feel normal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Unless you're one of those rare few who keep themselves limber enough to not have that problem.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Lower back hurt?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Once again, our muscle structure is designed to hold us in place, but if we only work one side of the muscle (ex: bending forward but not backward) then we will eventually grow lopsided, which produces pain, which is "cured" with more prescribed drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				i think OP is trying to argue:  A.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates and Marijuana have similar pain reducing properties, although not identical.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				B.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates can cause addiction and overdose, Marijuana can not.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				C.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Therefore, Marijuana can be a safe substitute for Opiates in certain cases.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think OP's argument goes like this:  1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates are legal drugs  2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Opiates caused some deaths, pretty bad  3.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana can do the painkilling work of Opiates too  4.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why don't we legalize Marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				__________________________________  Sounds like an OK argument.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think the real flaw is that OP needs to prove legalized marijuana will perform better than Opiates, while it is very likely to face the same issue troubled Opiates: overdose and abuse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That argument isn't valid either.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The conclusion doesn't follow from the premises.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In fact, it suffers the naturalistic fallacy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Could you cite some cases where someone overdosed on marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Any dose that is too large is an overdose.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I know that you are referring to a fatal or near fatal instance but it is important to understand that you CAN overdose on cannabis; it just isn’t fatal	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yes, but isnt it dishonest to paint the overdoses from opiates in the same light as overdoses from weed?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree, it’s not a fair comparison in the slightest.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When someone overdoses there is usually a seizure, ambulance called, fluids given until that person is okay or dies.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Overdose on marijuana?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They might find you asleep, but that's about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Believe me, I totally agree.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Their is no comparison between an opioid OD and a cannabis OD; I was just saying that it is (obviously) possible to take too large of a dose of THC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The comparison sickens me, but I just am trying to be honest with myself I guess.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In retrospect, it is kind of funny to think that if you OD on THC that you can counteract the overwhelming effects by ingesting CBD.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In other words, if you ingested too much of one form of cannabis, just take this other form of cannabis to even you out.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Its weird to think that one form of the drug can debilitate you while another form of the drug can counteract it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That is something you cannot say about opiates!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, I realize that calling CBD “another form” of cannabis probably isn’t the best way to describe it; but I hope you know what I meant.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Firstly, we should drop the barriers to cannabis research.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Right now it's impossible to do federally-funded research on it (see: any).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We can compare some information and data, but we can't do anything in depth.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We genuinely don't know how harmful smoking marijuana is, and one reason there are no deaths via marijuana is because we can't really know much about it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The effects are like smoking cigarettes - they take a while to come out.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's not like heroin that will kill you relatively fast and make you physically change.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We should make cannabis legal to a healthy extent, but we don't know that extent.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One negative effect would be the way legalization would strip away the market for it in certain segments of impoverished communities.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The reason they can profit off of it is because they have no legitimated competition and it is unregulated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Anyone can just trade it and make a good profit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The potential for being caught is obviously still worth the risk for the many thousands that do this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If made legal, it would become a corporate thing.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Good for the upper class, bad for the common dealer just making their own way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				One alternative to straight up legalization would be decriminalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This way, you would not license anyone to produce or sell it, and it would still be illegal, yet instead of prison, it would at most carry a moderate fine.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This would keep away corporate competition and encourage low level dealers to flourish, stimulating the lower class economy.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Actually, the black market is still thriving in legal states.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The legal market is so heavily taxed, and in some states (not sure about all) you are legally allowed to have a small crop, which you could sell wholesale to a dispensary if you wanted, or...you know...anyone else under the table.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As a consumer in a legal state, I buy a large margin of my stuff on the black market still.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I got a guy who grows in his basement, another one who makes his own distillate, and then another who makes edibles, like ice cream.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't think it's entirely screwing over impoverished communities as you would think, as they get tax benefits from the legal sales, and people are still selling on the street.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Source: I live in Colorado	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s a gateway drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You get high on it frequently you want to experiment with new highs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s been linked to schizophrenia if you have it at a younger age (0-20)    It smells, for people who don’t want to be around weed it might as well be antisocial behaviour.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smoking is still bad for your lungs and causes more health problems, which is how most people take marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s linked to depression.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So basically, it’s expensive to control, it’s unhealthy in more ways than useful, and there are many alternatives alternatives compared to medical marijuana, it causes more drug problems, more health problems, leads to anti social behaviour, you’d find people would drive intoxicated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It’s a thing nobody really needs, and it’s illegal for good reasons.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree, if there are medical applications where they are proven by a variety of sources as superior, they should be legalized.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, my issue with marijuana is that you can get someone 'second-hand high,' and that would be just terrible if they were going to operate heavy machinery or drive.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But if they privately do that on their own time, I would be perfectly fine with it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Their life, after all.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Contact high is a myth.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You'd have to be inside an unventilated room or a car with all the windows rolled up with people smoking an ungodly amount of high-strength ganja to even get a mild buzz second hand, and in cases like that, you would be there voluntarily, unless you had a gun pointed at your head.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I did some digging, and you are in fact right: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037687161500160X  Contact high seems very hard, but if you're walking down the street and everyone's smoking a joint, it wouldn't be hard to imagine getting "detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory."	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's actually not true at all...it's why saying "I don't smoke but my friend did next to me so maybe that's why my piss test was positive..." is bullshit because you can't even absorb enough thc to be significant to get you high and metabolize in your body unless you yourself smoke it	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				im curious how you think someone could get a second-hand high ?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				i mean short of being in a car with someone and all the windows rolled up people don't get high by smelling pot  smoke	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I do agree with the "second-hand high" issue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I believe that is states with legal recreational marijuana, there is no smoking allowed in public.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, we all know how people are with following simple laws such as this.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, marijuana does not have to be smoked, it can be ingested in numerous ways.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That great that there's person specific application, but there's a final consideration.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You really shouldn't make cannabis 'entirely legal' but just place the same restrictions on it as alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone wants to use it recreationally, they should treat it like it's alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If they want to impair themselves, that's their own issue.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				However, if they crash a car while high then we should treat them like they crashed a car while drunk.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				At least these basic regulations should be applied.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I definitely agree with strict regulations being set along with legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The impairment might be of a slightly different sort, however it's no excuse to put others in danger.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As someone who smokes a lot of weed, you can't really get second hand high from it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Maybe if you sealed yourself in a really confined area and hotboxed the thing for ages I guess?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Oh, this is just my speculation since I don't smoke that shit.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But keep in mind that in some states, any BAC above 0.00% is an offense if you are under the age of 21, and by applying alcohol laws to weed, a relevant question is also:  'can second hand smoke from weed show up on a drug test, and if so, how much before it begins to do so?'  In addition to the original 'how much second hand before you become impaired?'	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				lol, nope, even NIDA says that isn't true.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/secondhand-marijuana-smoke	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How about an edible?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So your issue is out the window	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Children shouldn't be able to choose to use marijuana it damages their brains and hurts their lungs	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> it damages their brains and hurts their lungs  Sources!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What would your argument be against using marijuana in forms other than those that have to be smoked?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And I get the premise of using it at a young age, however, and this is a very specific example, but children that experience frequent seizures can immediately benefit form regulated doses of CBD I believe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>What would your argument be against using marijuana in forms other than those that have to be smoked  So when you say "cannabis should be entirely legal" you mean smoking it should still be illegal?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>children that experience frequent seizures can immediately benefit form regulated doses of CBD I believe.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How would cannabis with a prescription not be a good solution for this?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If an individual wishes to smoke it, they should have the option...in the privacy of their own home.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The issue with smoke is similar to how smoking cigarettes in certain areas has been banned over the course of several years.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And yes, the prescription would be perfect.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My argument is that all states should have legal medical marijuana, because families that have a use for it and don't live in areas with it legalized, they have a much harder time finding treatment for the ill.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Dude what lol  The only way to ensure children are protected is to legalise.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My dealer didn't give a fuck if I was 15, a licensed store would.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If marijuana were legalized, then it would be regulated and most definitely would be only accessible to people over the legal age for alcohol or other legal drugs like cigarettes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When I was in high school, it was easier for me to buy pot than it was to buy alcohol or cigarettes because dealers don't card.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Plus, pot being illegal means you can only buy it on the black market and once you're connected to the black market, you have access to other drugs.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				For example, in high school I did LSD and ecstasy because I made the connections buying pot and I knew where to get the other stuff.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pot is only a "gateway drug" or because its illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				That's why it would have a legal age for purchase, like alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				As for medical use goes, kids with cancer or seizures would greatly benefit from it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And it's not like we would just hand them a bong.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				They take extracts of the helpful parts and put them into pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				These kids could be getting treatment with no THC but because of our bullshit government it's all illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				How about chemo that literally poisons their entire system.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Medicine has side effects that have nothing to do with lungs if it's not smoked and the effects on the brain is debatable.	NoArgument	test

NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I think that medical marijuana should be legal if prescribed by a doctor but I don't think it should be legal for recreational purposes.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even though I think smoking pot is no worse than smoking a cigarette I think keeping them both illegal would have a good influence on the country.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I agree medical marijuana should exist.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But I never understood the debate on recreational marijuana "because alcohol".	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is like having legal drinking cyanide and illegal drinking ammonia.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So you say "cyanide is legal and less harmful than ammonia, let's legalize ammonia" ignoring the fact that they both damage your health and maybe instead the alcohol should be banned.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"especially in the medical sense of the drug"  It's simple, go through the Clinical Trials to convince the FDA.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				There is no other way.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Now you mentioned Opioids, maybe you think "Opioids are pretty bad, killing people yet it's still legalized drug, why not Cannabis?"   Well, by its nature smoking weed is harder to be applied in standardized treatments than pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Plus, it's reasonable to predict that if cannabis is legalized, it would be abused and used in overdose like Opioids, if not worse.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If FDA is to give the pass on Cannabis as a replacement for Opioids, there should be reasons that Cannabis is better in some ways, but said reason is hard to find.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Pretty reasonable up until the end of your post.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't see why legalized cannabis would be abused more than illegal cannabis.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The main case for cannabis over opiods is that the risk of fatal overdose is effectively zero.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No-one has ever overdosed on Weed though have they	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Smoking it is only one of the many ways you can use marijuana.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can eat it, drink it, rub it on your skin, and yes you can even take pills.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No one is suggesting they blaze up in hospitals.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> Now, I'm not saying opioids don't have their upsides, as in late life pain reduction, but medical marijuana could replace painkillers in numerous cases.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Most of those uses are better handled by ibuprofen and such anyway.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But yea, this should be an option for certain cases.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana has the very useful side effect of increasing appetite, which is quite unmatched by other substances.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> As for recreational marijuana, I believe laws should be enacted that treat it in a way that is similar to alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				With a legal age of consumption and taxation that would then benefit the state.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just because you get taxes from it, doesn't mean it's a benefit for the state.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Take the examples of alcohol and cigarettes: they produce massive amounts of problems that offset the income from taxes by a huge margin.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In the case of alcohol it's assualts, rape, drunk driving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In the case of cigarettes it's cancer (the US "solves" this by just letting people die instead of treating them if they can't pay, but that doesn't make the economics that much better).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				> The legal age of consumption for recreational marijuana should be something like 18 or 21 in my opinion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So not like the title says "completely legal"?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just a nitpick of mine, but I think people should be clearer when talking about these things.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana should obviously not be legalized like water :P Pepsi shouldn't be able to put it in soft drinks for children.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Everything is a trade off and a sliding scale.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can get most medical benefits by removing the chemicals that generate a high but people don't want this to be known cause they really just want an excuse to get high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Part of the "high" is what helps people.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Like people who use it for sleep, or anxiety.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I used CBD daily to help the inflammation but in order to sleep or eat I would need the effect caused by a mix of CDB and THC.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Alright, here we go.   1) you specified 18-21. What if you hotbox your living room with a toddler?  2) what if you’re driving high (impaired).  At the very least insurance companies would lobby hard for restrictions to reduce risk. Why should they take on more risk?  3) what if you’re high at work around machinery. Again, insurance.   4) what if you’re high as a nurse. Would you prefer high nurse or sober nurse?  5) school bus driver?  6) police   7) fire   8) what’s the punishment for each?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What if they do it again?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				100% legal is never the reality.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We have to make it partially illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Well..	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				how partially illegal do we make it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Do we make punishments more severe?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Before, it was blanket illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But when we loosen restrictions we do expect responsible behavior.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Society is trusting that people will act responsibly.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So outright irresponsibility should come with greater consequences.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				A lot of the points you brought up could fall under regulations similar to alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's illegal to drive and work drink so it could be the same for MJ.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Please note medical marijuana that has only CBD and no THC often don't make the user slightly intoxicated.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, it's been studied that the more marijuana you smoke, the more you need to have a negative effect on your driving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just to clarify, it *is* illegal to drive under the influence of MJ.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And there is no quick and reliable way for a police officer to test if a driver is high or not like a breathalyzer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is my biggest problem with legalization.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The officer can administer a sobriety test based on coordination and mental function (ie the alphabet backward thing, walking a straight line, etc).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If there's no obvious impairment one should wonder if there's a problem at all in the first place.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This comment makes it seem like you are implying that driving under the influence of marijuana is okay.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Am I correct in assuming this?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And field sobriety tests are not scientific and are only used as the preliminary test in order to justify a breathalyzer.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				"He stuttered while reciting the alphabet backwards" would not stand up in court.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				And if you can't properly prosecute offenders than there is no deterrence factor.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What little science we have says that it is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				While being high does affect your reaction time, unlike alcohol, it doesn't affect judgement.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Subjects compensate by driving more carefully.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, the accident rates in states that have legalized all show downward trends since legalization, further reinforcing that there isn't a problem to be concerned about.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				>What little science we have   That's all I need to know.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In my personal experience, I can tell you I am basically retarded when I am high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If there is overwhelming evidence over a solid period of time that there is absolutely zero adverse effects than I will be happy to support it, but I find it unlikely that the evidence is even capable of being properly gathered.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The burden of proof is on the people supporting operating deadly machinery on public roads while under the influence of a drug.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But you can’t set a lower standard for measure than alcohol.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It is (and should be) illegal to drive or operate dangerous machinery in *any* state of impairment, whether it be from substances, lack of sleep, or extreme emotional states.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is already the case, but many of these have no simple tests except for performance evaluation.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Performance is all that really matters, and if the testing for it is sub-par, such an enforcement challenge is no excuse for unreasonable laws.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Sleep deprivation is particularly common (even socially encouraged or outright required-in-practice in some industries!) and quite dangerous, yet routinely underestimated by those under its influence, woefully unenforced against, and criminally under-represented by awareness campaigns, politicking, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Tack on the fact that tolerances and degrees of impairment vary (even for alcohol, but much more so for cannabis) and there really can be no quick and reliable substance-based test anyway, except when blood concentration of something is just too extreme for doubt (and seriously, by then the impairment would be obvious anyway).	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Meanwhile, many people must (and do) operate vehicles and machinery while under the influence of pain medications that can cause equal and greater impairment than cannabis, yet they frequently do so safely because of properly regulated dosages, acclimation to the effects, and the self-knowledge of the user to know their level of impairment and what is or isn't safe to do as such.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If you're too <anything> to drive, **you don't**, doesn't matter what it is.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Although, unlike sleep deprivation or alcohol intoxication, cannabis doesn't impair your ability to note yourself as impaired, with users tending toward excess caution instead.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Finally, operating a vehicle unsafely is a crime regardless of its cause, adding on laws against alleged "pre-crime" does nothing but add charges to trump up, with the collateral damages of eroding the legitimacy of constitutional law and undermining faith therein, and infringing the rights of responsible users.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone is seen to be driving unsafely, it doesn't matter how they got that way, just that they should get off the road.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If someone gets into an accident due to irresponsible choices, they're culpable for it all the same, regardless of which particular bad choices were made.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The nanny-state micromanagement is just political and business BS that violates everyone's natural right to bodily autonomy for the sake of cheap votes and unearned dollars.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can't stop people from being reckless idiots.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				People smoke cigarettes around their toddlers and drive drunk everyday.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I don't see why marijuana should be illegal when these more dangerous things aren't.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But the goal is to limit exposure.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				When we find lead in water, we don’t equivocate and say it will only make kids a little retarded.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But consuming lead is dangerous.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It can kill you, and it has no health benefits.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Marijuana has never killed anyone, and it helps people in pain or people who suffer from seizures.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Also, no one is advocating that kids be allowed to smoke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So...bad comparison.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Eh, you’re not in full possession of the facts:  http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/11/marijuana-brain.aspx	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				?????	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I've stated multiple times I don't believe kids should be allowed to smoke.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What does this link have to do with anything?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				By this logic we should ban alcohol too.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				It's easier for kids to get because it's legal for adults so therefore it should be illegal for everyone.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				No more casual beer drinking for you!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Think of the children you monster!!!!!	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What about parents who hot box their kids?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Why should I be punished for what some retard parents do?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				CPS exists for a reason.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Parents can also go to the store and buy hammers and murder their children with hammers.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Should we outlaw hammers?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So it is illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Child neglect.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The Whole OP is about making weed legal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Cigarettes in front of kids isn’t illegal.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But you say weed should be.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So we agree.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can’t smoke in front of kids.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Yeah, but I think if parents want to smoke at night while their kids are sleeping in a different room, they should have the legal right to do that.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Even if it becomes legal, companies can still issue drug tests, right?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				In the case of jobs where you operate heavy machinery or drive, etc.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				where it could be fatal to be high while operating.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Insurance companies demand it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				But you have to watch the whole ‘its legal’.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If an insurance company doesn’t write you a policy, you’re as good as fucked	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The points you make aren't what legal use advocates are working towards.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I’m sure, but we can’t continue to move goal posts because of broad statements like: it’s legal now.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Your arguments are right up there with "fast food shouldn't be legal because people are distracted while eating in the car"	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Eating fast food in the car....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If cause of accidents attributed to eating are up there with fast food...	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What about driving while on Percocet?	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Driving while distracted at all is dangerous, and so is driving while tired	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				So we can continue to make a list of what is dangerous to do while driving....	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				My response will always be that we need to focus on reducing impairment.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If weed causes impaired driving....you know my stance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Having it be legal hasn't increased the arrests for driving while impaired	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				We’ve yet to develop a test.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You don't think cops can tell if somebody is impaired???	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				To respond to a few:  1.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Active ingredients when smoking weed are usually all absorbed before you exhale.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You can say the same thing about cigarettes, but they're commonly accepted, even though they kill more than 10 times as many individuals each year.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				2.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Driving high should be treated the same as drinking while driving OR taking any other drugs while driving.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				I believe it is difficult to tell if most drugs are currently active in your system,  but there are different field sobriety tests and other scientific ways for them to come to a conclusion.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				3.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				What if you're drunk at work???	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				invalid response IMO.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				4.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				You get fired if you don't do your job properly or are found to be high.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Just like any other psychoactive substance.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				5.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				This is a criminal matter and is already an issue that LE have handled before.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				6, 7, 8 - Issues with employment, not criminal issues.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				The burden of consequence should not fall on the law, it should fall on the workplace in the cases where crimes weren't committed.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				If people want to get high and work, they are already doing it.	NoArgument	test
medical marijuana				Legalizing may increase the amount of users, but I honestly think you have too little faith in the morals which individuals have.	NoArgument	test

video games				There's this fella named Richard Wilkinson.	NoArgument	test
video games				He did a TED talk several years ago about the effects of income inequality on societies.	NoArgument	test
video games				I have to make this very clear up front: When I say the words income inequality you should not jump to thinking only of people in poverty.	NoArgument	test
video games				His data showed some very shocking things that changed me politically ever since.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's going to be very hard to boil it down, you probably don't have time to watch it though.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyway here we go, income inequality as determined by the gini coefficient is directly correlative with almost every single index on the UNICEF index of human welfare.	NoArgument	test
video games				What's on the UNICEF index of human welfare?	NoArgument	test
video games				Several things.	NoArgument	test
video games				The most notable of them are the following:  Mental health and drug addiction, teen pregnancy, literacy rates, homicide rates, crime rates, imprisonment rates, life expectancy, and one huge one..	NoArgument	test
video games				societal trust.	NoArgument	test
video games				The shocking part of this data is that it strikes across social classes.	NoArgument	test
video games				It seems to hit everyone from the poor to the rich.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even the ultra-wealthy suffer some effects from inequality.	NoArgument	test
video games				It does hit the rich less then the poor but the impact is still statistically notable.	NoArgument	test
video games				So what does all this have to do with your view?	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe that the underlying cause...	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't want to say it like that actually.	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe one of the factors in mass shootings is the inequality in America.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think the specific person has to experience the Inequality, they merely need to be affected by its impact on the society on whole.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like I said one of the big things in that index is mental health.	NoArgument	test
video games				If income inequality is a societal indicator of more mental health issues, and mass shootings are tied to mental health, then income inequality by extension is partially responsible for these mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				Furthermore, hyper-partisanship, I believe, is tied to societal trust.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like I said earlier societal trust is part of that UNICEF index.	NoArgument	test
video games				The correlation between societal trust is so shocking I can hardly believe it.	NoArgument	test
video games				So if hyper-partisanship plays a role in mass shootings, and mental health plays a role in mass shootings..	NoArgument	test
video games				yeah man umm..	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you've got some of the picture but not all of it.	NoArgument	test
video games				We need to find the common denominator right.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hyper-partisanship linked to societal trust, linked to income inequality.	NoArgument	test
video games				mental health linked to mass shootings, mental health linked to income inequality.	NoArgument	test
video games				The most depressing thing is though..	NoArgument	test
video games				nobody talks about either your point or mine wish may both be contributing to the issue in an undetermined amount.	NoArgument	test
video games				The entire debate after these events always revolves around guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am afraid if we removed the guns we would just see bombings because the underlying causes would lay untreated.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				I should note that Wilkinson's data was pretty strict for selection of countries.	NoArgument	test
video games				His data applies specifically to Rich Western democracies as he put it.	NoArgument	test
video games				https://youtu.be/cZ7LzE3u7Bw  You can see the information here in a digestible video format, or you can go to his foundation's website, it should be called something like the spirit level, named after a book that he wrote with another person named Pickett  As well I don't mean to imply that it's the sole cause of these attacks.	NoArgument	test
video games				To attribute any one thing to all of these attacks would be insane.	NoArgument	test
video games				The United States is likely a perfect storm of conditions that is resulting in these attacks.	NoArgument	test
video games				I do not want to make a determination on how much mental health impacts it, nor do I want to make a determination on how much guns impact it.	NoArgument	test
video games				These are unknown quantities to me, and I don't think that we can assign values to them.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm never going to be able to tell you that income inequalities effects contributed 20% to the motivations to carry out the El Paso shooting or whatever..	NoArgument	test
video games				it could be 1% it could be 20% it could be 100% it could be 0%.	NoArgument	test
video games				I genuinely don't know, all I know is that we are, in the media at least, only talking about guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't know if we can actually look at other countries to see if they have solutions..	NoArgument	test
video games				because they don't have the problem lol this is like almost strictly American, it needs an American solution.	NoArgument	test
video games				One thing we haven't tried is lowering income inequality, it has risen at the same time that mass shootings have.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's all I'm saying, it's just a hypothesis that it may be related.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't know how much I don't know if at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't even know how to test the hypothesis dude lol..	NoArgument	test
video games				I suppose the only way is to lower inequality and see if the shootings go down.	NoArgument	test
video games				I hate to keep editing my post..	NoArgument	test
video games				I just want to make it absolutely one hundred percent clear.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am making a correlative argument...	NoArgument	test
video games				Not just that..	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm making a correlative argument based on data that does not track mass shootings at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				It tracks homicides, it tracks mental illness, it tracks societal distrust and it tracks about 50 other variables too.	NoArgument	test
video games				So all those caveats aside, if it touches so much..	NoArgument	test
video games				what are the chances that it touches this issue too?	NoArgument	test
video games				It seems that it's all one giant web, everything interconnected and leading up to this one single issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't know jack shit, but I wouldn't be surprised, that's for goddamn sure	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m going to take a different angle than you might see by others.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not sure how many of these “political shootings” are actually motivated by politics, and not just a color of the day excuse.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meaning, if you were interested in committing mass murder tomorrow, and fame matters to you, you’d piggy back off the hottest topic in the news.	NoArgument	test
video games				Right now it’s immigration.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ll use the El Paso shooter since there’s information out, and it’s fresh.	NoArgument	test
video games				Going through his manifesto, it reads like a guy in his late teens who desperately wants to control his imagine.	NoArgument	test
video games				He flip flops between trying to seem smart, and telling you if things seem sloppy, it’s because it’s not prepared.	NoArgument	test
video games				The part where he does explain his supposed political motivations, he uses stolen phrasing that doesn’t even make logical sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s also impossible for him to have made a dent, in the way he was suggesting.	NoArgument	test
video games				I heard about the shooting and manifesto in the news well before I read it, and I was honestly surprised they were buying the story they were selling.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Probably because it’s the bigger story)  It’s my opinion that he was less motivated by race and politics, and more motivated by fame, but of course there’s no way to know for sure.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would say that if someone is willing to go kill a large number of people, they maybe willing to fib a little about their motivation.	NoArgument	test
video games				!delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				Ok there probably is an argument to be made for social media and everyone wanting to be famous for existing.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ll concede that a fame aspect is definitely plausible here.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I still stand by my original argument that politicians and media give these people an outlet and a voice.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thanks for the comment	NoArgument	test
video games				>But I still stand by my original argument that politicians and media give these people an outlet and a voice.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thanks for the comment  Sure they do, but I’m not sure what you can do about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Many use the “mental health” argument because they don’t understand a normal person wanting their voice to sound like gun fire.	NoArgument	test
video games				I suppose it’s how you wish to define mental illness.	NoArgument	test
video games				The really sad part is, there’s really no way to stop the “fame” attraction.	NoArgument	test
video games				I keep expecting to hear stories come out about assassination attempts on Obama that were hidden.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s really surprising no serious attempts were made, simply because the killers name would likely be remembered for the rest of human history.	NoArgument	test
video games				Luckily the US president is an incredibly hard target.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sadly for the rest of us, we are not.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's fairly easy to get rid of the fame aspect.	NoArgument	test
video games				Media needs to stop using the shooters name and face when reporting on it.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no reason to give the shooter the fame he/she desires.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course they need to talk specifics, but they can do that without disclosing personal info about the shooter.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think that’s a bit of a mistake in thinking, with the type of fame these people seek.	NoArgument	test
video games				They’re committing the acts, because the population views the acts as special.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thus, they believe committing the acts will make them special.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s not necessarily having their name attached to the act in everyone’s mind, it’s having their act in everyone’s mind.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here’s an example.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t recall the Las Vegas shooters name, though it was everywhere in the news.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, I will never forget the act.	NoArgument	test
video games				I doubt the shooter cares whether I have to look up his name.	NoArgument	test
video games				What he most likely cared about is being the most effective mass shooter in history.	NoArgument	test
video games				To be fair, there will be some percentage who does care about their names and imagine specifically being burned into people’s mind, though I do believe there a minority.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just to add, I do not support this idea that the media shouldn’t report facts the public clearly has interest in.	NoArgument	test
video games				It drive me nuts that I ran across hundreds of articles breaking down the El Paso shooters supposed agenda, but the refused to link the actual manifesto.	NoArgument	test
video games				(It took me way longer to find than it should have)  It’s asinine media is attending to explain the “why” of an event, but not the “who, what, where, and  how.” That’s not news.	NoArgument	test
video games				There have probably been multiple assassination attempts, which backs the point of this post bringing light to the fact the media only tells the stories the politicians pay for.	NoArgument	test
video games				What?	NoArgument	test
video games				You think there were assassination attempts on Obama that were not broadcast because no politician was willing to pay the news for the story?	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not sure if you understand the business model...	NoArgument	test
video games				Im gonna half correct ya on the voice.	NoArgument	test
video games				Politics never "gave" anyone a voice.	NoArgument	test
video games				Politics came from many voices acting as one.	NoArgument	test
video games				Social media however gave these people a place to congregate without arousing suspicion because ita away form prying eyes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here is where all that, in my opinion is invalid.	NoArgument	test
video games				In order to actually shoot some place up, you need MULTIPLE factors.	NoArgument	test
video games				A sense of discord/hate/hurt from some outside source, a means, and a plan.	NoArgument	test
video games				The "politics" gave these people an easy to chew sense of discord.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it wasn't politics then it would have been racism, or a bad burger king burger.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its only a matter of time and what.	NoArgument	test
video games				A means: these shooters have easy access to guns with bacjground checks yes, but our modern sysyems dont account for some of the bigger violence red flags we have now (domestic violence, animal cruelty, etc)  A plan.	NoArgument	test
video games				These people had plans, or at least ideas, WELL before they had anything else and its the only thing we as a society with laws cannot do anything about.	NoArgument	test
video games				Politics is only the topic that madethese people FEEL enough to act on it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you watched these same people at a dead end job for the next 10 years or so it would have been about that job.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its not WHAT they kill over.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its WHO does the killing.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Social media however gave these people a place to congregate without arousing suspicion because it’s away from prying eyes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Social media also gives these people a group of like-minded individuals who make them believe their opinions are valid and encourage their destructive behavior.	NoArgument	test
video games				It takes a person on the brink of an attack and gives him the psychological ammunition to act.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Politics is only the topic that made these people FEEL enough to act on it.	NoArgument	test

video games				Violence isn’t new.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hate isn’t new.	NoArgument	test
video games				There have always been and will always be people who are going to attempt mass homicide.	NoArgument	test
video games				A spree shooting over politics is just the most popular method right now.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a terrorist says they did it for Allah everyone believes them, must be an honest murderer, I'd say if the terrorist said they did it for any other reason they wouldn't be called a terrorist, at least that seems to be the case: the public have decided only Muslims can be terrorists, regardless of the actual definitions for terrorism.	NoArgument	test
video games				It means the public operate in a different stream of consciousness to technical jargon and academia.	NoArgument	test
video games				In America, if a shooter isn't a right-wing fanatic they are probably called a lone wolf, like how Terrorism is singularly associated with Islam, mass shootings have become singularly associated with right-wing fanaticism.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the media wants those perceptions to grow they will only cover cases that validate it, they control the MSM, it is a free press.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now I'm not against Free Press but (there's always a "but" isn't there? Daddy said everything someone says before "but" is BS) BUT conflating tabloid with journalism is a dangerous path, delivering clinical facts isn't the same as deciding what to do with it, Einstein didn't support Nukes because he was a pacifist, does a gun manufacturer giggle to themselves whenever 40 people die from their product in a massacre?	NoArgument	test
video games				One would hope not, Sarah Winchester went nuts from it.	NoArgument	test
video games				TL;DNR: I'd say people are ignored until they snap, then they are covered on national and international news, I'd say that's rewarding bad behavior and undermining democracy in the same stroke...	NoArgument	test
video games				> It’s also impossible for him to have made a dent, in the way he was suggesting.	NoArgument	test
video games				It seems like that but remember...WWI was started by one 19 year-old guy shooting someone ([Gavrilo Princip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip)).	NoArgument	test
video games				I think some shooters hope they are the spark like Princip was.	NoArgument	test
video games				While it seems crazy, Princip shows it is possible for one nut with a gun to actually cause massive upheaval.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most don't but you can never say never.	NoArgument	test

video games				Dallas shooting that left 5 cops dead, the Republican baseball game shooting, the recent Dayton shooting, want me to continue?	NoArgument	test
video games				Trying to turn in this into a partisan issue rather than a humanitarian one makes YOU a part of the problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Congressional_baseball_shooting	NoArgument	test
video games				Seriously?	NoArgument	test
video games				The easy and obvious answers would be the 2017 Congress baseball shooting and the Dayton shooting that was last weekend.	NoArgument	test
video games				The ballpark shooting was politically influenced, but I don’t think you can claim the Dayton killings were.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sure the shooter in that case supporter left wing politics, but his crimes don’t appear to have been *influenced* by left wing views.	NoArgument	test
video games				To the contrary, FBI findings seem to indicate that he was associated with misogynistic incel groups, which are more aligned with the right when it comes to gender issues.	NoArgument	test
video games				That isn’t to say the incel connections are the reason for the shooting, but more that it doesn’t appear the shooting in Dayton was politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				To the contrary, the El Paso shooting absolutely *was* motivated by far right white supremacist ideology.	NoArgument	test
video games				The shooter in this case killed people with the explicit goal of harming Latinx people, in the hopes to further their goal of a far-right White ethnostate in the US.	NoArgument	test
video games				They weren’t just someone who held these views, the committed their shooting because of these views.	NoArgument	test
video games				The trying to say the right and the left were equally responsible for these shootings is a fall equivalency that’s incredibly disingenuous.	NoArgument	test
video games				The Dayton shooter does not seem to have committed his crimes for political reasons, the El Paso shooter very clearly did.	NoArgument	test
video games				Moreover, violent crime influenced by far-right ideology currently dwarfs similar crimes committed by people motivated by far-left beliefs.	NoArgument	test
video games				This isn’t an issue where both sides are equally to blame, and while there is a fair debate to be had over what responsibility the mainstream right bears for this issue, data over the past few years very clearly shows that the US had a real problem with an upsurge in violent far-right groups.	NoArgument	test
video games				> To the contrary, FBI findings seem to indicate that he was associated with misogynistic incel groups, which are more aligned with the right when it comes to gender issues.	NoArgument	test
video games				This guy was in a polyamorous relationship and was in a band where all the men wore dresses, if he was an "incel" he would detest these things.	NoArgument	test
video games				Honestly I don't find it that hard to believe that he did the shooting out of rage due to the El Paso shooting given that he was angrily tweeting about it all day before committing the act.	NoArgument	test
video games				That being said the game people play where "my body count is lower therefor I'm right!" is silly.	NoArgument	test
video games				Getting shot doesn't make you right and people need to stop pretending that it does.	NoArgument	test
video games				> This guy was in a polyamorous relationship and was in a band where all the men wore dresses, if he was an "incel" he would detest these things.	NoArgument	test
video games				He may not have been an incel specifically, but we know he was involved with these groups, and we know that he had a long history of extremely troubling misogynistic behavior.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was suspended from high school for [creating a list of female classmates that he wanted to rape](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dayton-gunman-reportedly-had-hit-lists-fascination-shootings-everyone-knew-n1039391).	NoArgument	test
video games				A former acquaintance reported that[ he had at one point choked his girlfriend as a teen](https://abcnews.go.com/US/alleged-dayton-gunman-connor-betts-showed-signs-misogyny/story?id=64826324), and he most recent girlfriend broke up with him over fears that he could become violent.	NoArgument	test
video games				His band might have worn dresses, but they were part of a sub-genre [know for misogynistic and sexually violent themes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Dayton_shooting).	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not saying we can conclusively say misogyny played a role in the Dayton murders, but we have enough evidence that I don't think we can just simply overlook that possibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Honestly I don't find it that hard to believe that he did the shooting out of rage due to the El Paso shooting given that he was angrily tweeting about it all day before committing the act.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree that the El Paso attack may have been a trigger, and the Dayton shooters acquaintances do report that he showed a really concerning interest in mass violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				That being said, what I'm objecting to is the notion that the Dayton shooter was politically motivated, or worse yet that this shooting was an equivalent left wing motivated crime that makes this a "both sides" issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				I worry that attempts to frame the recent shootings as a issue on both sides of the political spectrum unjustifiably obscures the fact that we have a [significant and growing problem with far-right violence in the US](https://www.businessinsider.com/extremist-killings-links-right-wing-extremism-report-2019-1), but not a similar problem with violence on the far left.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not trying to say all people on the right are responsible for this trend, but when I hear folks create a false equivalency like this it prevents a needed discussion on how to prevent far-right ideology from radicalizing Americans into committing violent acts, as this is absolutely an issue we need to tackle.	NoArgument	test
video games				> 'm not saying we can conclusively say misogyny played a role in the Dayton murders, but we have enough evidence that I don't think we can just simply overlook that possibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look we are clearly dealing with a damaged individual but your assumption is that women hate is unique to being a right winger which is obviously not true.	NoArgument	test
video games				>That being said, what I'm objecting to is the notion that the Dayton shooter was politically motivated, or worse yet that this shooting was an equivalent left wing motivated crime that makes this a "both sides" issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				Ok but if he was a radical leftist that was gaslight into shooting up a bar by the media in the wake of the El Paso shooting then that seems political to me.	NoArgument	test
video games				I find it very hard to believe that he just popped off for no reason at all given his political affiliations and tweets earlier that day.	NoArgument	test
video games				>I worry that attempts to frame the recent shootings as a issue on both sides of the political spectrum unjustifiably obscures the fact that we have a significant and growing problem with far-right violence in the US  Using ADL data for "white supremacy" would be like using Adolf Hitler's data for Jews.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is an incredibly partisan and biased organization that will do things like count bank robberies and prison murders as "white supremacy."	NoArgument	test
video games				I appreciate your sentiment and point but this was never meant to be a left vs right argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is about politics and partisan media being to blame for radicalizing these people	NoArgument	test
video games				I suppose I disagree with a core part of your premise though.	NoArgument	test
video games				You explicitly frame this as an issue with polarization on the right *and* the left.	NoArgument	test
video games				What I’m saying is that, when it comes to politically motivated mass shootings, the problem overwhelmingly lays with radicalization on the extreme far-right.	NoArgument	test
video games				It isn’t partisanship alone that’s driving violence in some of these shootings, it’s specific ideologies held by those to the furthest on the right that explicitly encourage and uphold violent crime as a legitimate means of promoting political objectives.	NoArgument	test
video games				That being said, let’s broaden the picture, because I don’t think we can claim politics is at the root of most mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				To the contrary, it’s doesn’t appear there is any one motive that ties these crimes together.	NoArgument	test
video games				The majority of mass shooters don’t have a diagnosable mental illness, the majority don’t have clear political motives, and the majority don’t commit their crimes in the hopes of gaining wealth or fame.	NoArgument	test
video games				While we can sort motivations into broad categories, each shooter kills for reasons that are ultimately uniquely their own.	NoArgument	test
video games				What does unite these shooters however is the simple fact that they had easy access to firearms, even when those who knew them often feared they would turn violent.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not suggesting we need a full repeal of the 2nd amendment or anything, but what is clear is that we need to be doing more to control how people access firearms.	NoArgument	test
video games				Better background checks and licensing courses have broad public approval, yet they’re not being voted on due to incredibly aggressive lobbying.	NoArgument	test
video games				At least some of these shooters might have been screened out with greater scrutiny, not to mention many others who went on to misuse firearms in a more limited way, potentially saving hundreds of lives.	NoArgument	test
video games				“The majority of mass shooters don’t have a diagnosable mental illness, the majority don’t have clear political motives, and the majority don’t commit their crimes in the hopes of gaining wealth or fame.”  I appreciate the argument but how exactly does heavier screening deal with something that doesn’t apply to the majority of mass shooters?	NoArgument	test
video games				To be blunt, better screening isn't going to stop all violent firearm crime.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell, it probably wouldn't even stop mass shootings completely.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, these steps would help prevent people who had violent histories or showed clearly troubling behavior, which is not at all unheard of, from obtaining weapons.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if that only reduced gun crimes by 5%, that's still saving *thousands* of people from harm.	NoArgument	test
video games				At the same time, these steps wouldn't harm the rights of responsible gun owners, who would be able to proceed through background checks and basic licencing courses without issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				These aren't the only steps we could take when it comes to firearm regulation, but they're absolutely two of the most obvious.	NoArgument	test

video games				> but feared whites would vanish  The idea of whiteness only exists in contrast to people being "non-white".	NoArgument	test
video games				Irish, spanish, slavics, italians; are they white?	NoArgument	test
video games				It's a matter of current day politics.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it's acceptable to cast them out, they will, if it's not, they won't.	NoArgument	test
video games				The idea of supremacy is inherent to the idea of white people "vanishing" because any mixed person is automatically seen as "non-white".	NoArgument	test
video games				Obama was seen as the first black president, but despite him being partially white, nobody saw him as a white president.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				You are conflating a number of terms that are not comparable.	NoArgument	test
video games				Black and white, within a specific context are comparable.	NoArgument	test
video games				But Japanese, Indian, African specifically refer to people from distinct locations (Africa a bit broader, but still geographical).	NoArgument	test
video games				You could expand them to ethnicities (at least in he case of Japanese, to an extent), but that would still be incomparable to white and black, which refer to race.	NoArgument	test
video games				The Congress Baseball shooting is the *only* even semi legit example, and it was a failed shooting at that.	NoArgument	test
video games				The Dayton shooting was not politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				The shooter was a misogynist who murdered his sister.	NoArgument	test
video games				It was a personal issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't just claim like, any time someone murders their spouse for cheating on them it's politically motivated just because they retweeted political tweets a handful of times.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only reason there is this false equivalence narrative here is because there was a right wing terrorist attack the day before.	NoArgument	test
video games				And that one defi5was political because he was specifically shooting the ethnic minority the president is blaming for our societal ills.	NoArgument	test
video games				So all things said, you've got a single botched leftist attack [compared to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/clvogt/list_of_farrightwhite_nationalists_killings_from/)	NoArgument	test
video games				I gave two simple examples off the top of my head.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are absolutely more of you care to look.	NoArgument	test
video games				Once again I am NOT blaming liberals for these shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				For me personally a liberal is someone who I simply disagree with how the budget should be spent.	NoArgument	test
video games				I can say the same thing for the average conservative for what it’s worth.	NoArgument	test
video games				This isn’t an argument about simple political ideology but more a case against politicians and media riling people up in favor of votes and ratings at the expense of radicalizing people	NoArgument	test
video games				I do think you need to answer the question, not just "go and look"    > Where is there record of a US shooting explicitly motivated by leftist politics?	NoArgument	test
video games				Leftists aren't liberals: if you weren't equivocating leftists with the alt right, that's definitely not clear in your premise.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, CNN panders to libs not leftists, so its it's not a good example to provide for radicalization since they're going after boomer centrists.	NoArgument	test
video games				And please,  find me these other leftist attacks you think exist.	NoArgument	test
video games				Because that first anecdote is the only legit one *ever* brought up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Once again I’m not blaming one political side or the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				Stop trying to make this a left vs right argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				For the last time I’m blaming PARTISAN POLITICAL RHETORIC.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t hate the left.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the contrary I think there are many good arguments to be had with both sides of the aisle.	NoArgument	test
video games				But since you insist on making this a leftist vs liberal argument here it is.	NoArgument	test
video games				A liberal is a left leaning politician who focuses more on government spending for those they deem less fortunate.	NoArgument	test
video games				A leftist as far as I am willing to concede for the sake of argument is a socialist.	NoArgument	test
video games				There.	NoArgument	test
video games				Shouldn’t you be though?	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s been established that one side produces many more mass shootings?	NoArgument	test
video games				If I was trying to find the cause of mass shootings I’d take that into account.	NoArgument	test
video games				To help level the playing field I’ll mention a congressional baseball shooting and an ice attack.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, the vast majority of mass killings that I’ve heard of are done by conservative/right wing/whatever actors.	NoArgument	test
video games				I do honestly believe that the polarization of politics plays a big part like you say, however it certainly seems that one side responds much more violently than the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the ICE guy would clearly have done more if he could.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the right are just better at it.	NoArgument	test
video games				When you consider that one side is used to doing stuff and the other side is used to getting other people to do stuff for them, it makes sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				Still makes the right the bigger threat, but I don't think it's due to lack of desire on the left.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not sure about that.	NoArgument	test
video games				I haven’t seen a bunch of failed left leaning attacks.	NoArgument	test
video games				heck, the Dayton dude although not politically motivated was plenty effective.	NoArgument	test
video games				I personally think it’s more an ideological issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				Liberals generally don’t hurt people, on the rare occasions they do act violently it is typically directed towards property.	NoArgument	test
video games				For all the talk about antifa I still haven’t seen a body, but it’s easy to find stories about eco-terrorists burning down suv in car lots or freeing animals being used for research or whatever.	NoArgument	test
video games				incorrect assumption.	NoArgument	test
video games				a leftist, or the far-left, is an anarchist or a communist.	NoArgument	test
video games				socialists, at least democratic socialists, aren't far-left.	NoArgument	test

video games				I don't remember the other, could you describe the connection for me?	NoArgument	test
video games				Satanism aside, the Dayton shooter was an avid supporter of antifa.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes he was sick I’m not disputing that but the shooting was absolutely politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				The 2017 shooting which you are unaware of took place when a devoted Bernie Sanders supporter James Hodgkinson (sorry if I misspelled) opened fire on republican congress members practicing for a congress baseball game.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was an avid leftist activist and actually asked security if the congress members were republicans or democrats before he made the decision to open fire on them.	NoArgument	test

video games				If those weren’t leftist politically motivated I don’t know what is.	NoArgument	test

video games				Yes one side is far far far more violent then the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				But his original CMV still stands regardless of the existence of leftist terrorism.	NoArgument	test
video games				Dude...	NoArgument	test
video games				he was a Warren voter.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's not leftism.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was a liberal, even by your standards, and there's no real evidence he was a leftist activist.	NoArgument	test
video games				One with hateful views on women, calling him a leftist sounds like you're looking for an excuse to make a "both sides are just as bad" argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				These shootings come from Nazis, killing random people for no reason is directly against leftist ideology.	NoArgument	test
video games				antifa means anti-fascist, you know that right?	NoArgument	test
video games				it isn't a political or terror organization.	NoArgument	test
video games				antifa is not organized, it is literally anyone who believes fascism is wrong.	NoArgument	test

video games				There is no 'literal devil'.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are literal devil worshippers though	NoArgument	test
video games				Satanists aren't necessarily devil worshipers.	NoArgument	test
video games				Satanism is more about hedonism.	NoArgument	test
video games				Edit: Downvote all you like, it's a fact.	NoArgument	test
video games				Satan was thrown out of heaven for being hedonistic.	NoArgument	test
video games				I know that the satanic bible is secular.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's why I added "devil worshipping."  His Twitter has been hidden, but from what I recall, he literally actually worshipped the Christian devil.	NoArgument	test

video games				Please do not condescend.	NoArgument	test
video games				Dayton?	NoArgument	test
video games				Could you link me to the Dayton shooter's manifesto where he details his leftist policies and motivation for the shooting?	NoArgument	test
video games				His first victim was his sister.	NoArgument	test
video games				As far as I know people are just saying it was political because he identified as a Democrat.	NoArgument	test
video games				Apologies, the question mark in my first comment wasn't to be snarky.	NoArgument	test
video games				I wasn't certain, just heard hearsay that he was motivated by leftist politics.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah, there is zero evidence the shooting was motivated by "leftist ideology".	NoArgument	test
video games				The FBI evidence so far points to the contrary, given that he associated with misogynistic incel groups.	NoArgument	test
video games				I see.	NoArgument	test
video games				What were the misogynistics incel groups?	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't see how those would be contrary to leftists.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyone can be a misogynistic incel.	NoArgument	test
video games				He had rape lists and hit lists in high school, and his classmates say he was scarily anti-women.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was also into “pornocore,” which is apparently hardcore music that focuses on the brutal rape and assault of women.	NoArgument	test
video games				Reports seem to indicate that the shooting was motivated by those factors rather than by his political leanings.	NoArgument	test
video games				The choice of location and lack of any sort of manifesto (that we are aware of) suggest to me that there were other motives.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t think that one has to be on the right politically to be an incel or a misogynist.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like you said, anyone can be an incel.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was apparently a Warren supporter, which contradicts the misogynist thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				But he was also in favor of gun control, which contradicts the shooting thing, so who the hell knows.	NoArgument	test
video games				I see - thanks for the information.	NoArgument	test
video games				All seems like the doing of someone mentally unsound.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yep.	NoArgument	test
video games				Incels are a sub-category of the far-right internet ecosystem.	NoArgument	test
video games				Whilst certainly some left-side people exist who identify as incel, it is overwhelmingly a far-right community.	NoArgument	test
video games				This both sides bullshit has to stop, it further emboldens extremists.	NoArgument	test
video games				Leftists aren't mass murdering marginalized groups.	NoArgument	test
video games				And as devoid of information these TV ~~propaganda~~ news outlets are, they aren't *quite* as hyperbolic as you insinuate.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you are going insinuate leftists are in the same place as fascists, you're going to half to provide some evidence.	NoArgument	test
video games				Mass murderers are devoid of any sort of politics.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyone blaming a mass killing on anything other than mental illness, is also “mentally ill.”  Even if they mention politics as a motive in their manifesto, do we really take the words of a mass killer seriously?	NoArgument	test
video games				Do we really want to make an argument that, “Well if right wing politics didn’t exist, this person would’ve been a perfectly normal human with no ill will to the world!” It’s just not the case.	NoArgument	test
video games				They would find some other reason to kill...	NoArgument	test
video games				because they’re **mentally ill**.	NoArgument	test
video games				They don’t think like normal people.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Even if they mention politics as a motive in their manifesto,  Not *a* motive, *the* motive  >do we really take the words of a mass killer seriously?	NoArgument	test
video games				They're all saying the same fucking shit, so absolutely yes, we believe they are sincere about their motives.	NoArgument	test
video games				>They would find some other reason to kill...	NoArgument	test
video games				You think people are just born mass murderers, you don't think their worldview plays any factor?	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't think the fact that these white racist extremists all have the same values is in any way relevant?	NoArgument	test
video games				These are the rationalizations you are forced to resort to to convince yourself that the ideology is not at fault here?	NoArgument	test
video games				You're trying to rationalize irrational people.	NoArgument	test
video games				The motive of an irrational person is irrationally thought out.	NoArgument	test
video games				Their words are utter nonsense.	NoArgument	test
video games				They were not "born" mass murderers.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they certainly didn't watch Fox news and then decide to kill people.	NoArgument	test
video games				They distort the words of people into some irrational nonsense, and then go killing people.	NoArgument	test
video games				The same thing happened with "Catcher in the Rye", when Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon.	NoArgument	test
video games				He took a perfectly tame book, distorted the words of it (Because he was mentally ill, and did something irrational), and killed someone for no "real" reason.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you want to go ahead and blame J.D.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sallinger for his problematic book, go right on ahead.	NoArgument	test
video games				But for everyone else, it's obvious that Mark David Chapman was just mentally ill, and if he didn't read Catcher in the Rye, he would've read something else and killed someone because of *that* book.	NoArgument	test
video games				> They distort the words of people into some irrational nonsense  On the contrary, they take a logical conclusion [based on the sources they choose to believe.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/08/trump-immigrants-rhetoric-criticized-el-paso-dayton-shootings/1936742001/)  The irrational aspect is that they believe these opportunistic hate-mongers.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they're not distorting the message - the problem is that they're wholly *believing* the message.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Trump has used the words "predator," "invasion," "alien," "killer," "criminal" and "animal" at his rallies while discussing immigration more than 500 times.	NoArgument	test
video games				If that's the case, then everyone at the rally should be a killer.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or at least a statistically significant number of the people exposed to extremist politics should be extreme themselves.	NoArgument	test
video games				The fact that so few people actually turn to violence is a clear indication that it's not the message itself causing the violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you expose millions of people to a bad message, and then 2 become murderers because of it, it's statistically irrelevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's abundantly clear these are mentally ill individuals.	NoArgument	test
video games				>The fact that so few people actually turn to violence is a clear indication that it's not the message itself causing the violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				They're certainly not as personally invested in the cause.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they're perfectly okay with the imprisonment of children and general dehumanization of an entire race of people.	NoArgument	test
video games				State sanctioned violence can be every bit as morally reprehensible as illegal violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				>If you expose millions of people to a bad message, and then 2 become murderers because of it, it's statistically irrelevant.	NoArgument	test

NoArgument	test
video games				But it fits with the pursuit of the ideology.	NoArgument	test
video games				I counted 63 over the past 12 years.	NoArgument	test
video games				So 5.25/year.	NoArgument	test
video games				With a total of approximately 25 deaths/year.	NoArgument	test
video games				Statistically insignificant on an extremely large margin.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thank you for confirming that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Please look at the evidence you post in a different light.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course, *systematic* persecution is going to be far grander in scale.	NoArgument	test
video games				These extremists just highlight what's capable when folks take these hateful ideologies to their logical conclusion and are willing to resort to measures that aren't legal.	NoArgument	test
video games				> The logical conclusion.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you suggesting killing people is logical?	NoArgument	test
video games				No logical person is doing these acts.	NoArgument	test

video games				This is exactly the type of stupid shit this post is about.	NoArgument	test
video games				You sound like the typical “the right is all racist and wants to burn immigrants” shortsighted ass that I’m trying to argue against.	NoArgument	test
video games				It always makes me laugh when hard leftists use the term “fascist”.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look up the definition of that word.	NoArgument	test
video games				Turns out the antifa are practicing actual fascism	NoArgument	test
video games				How is Antifa the real facists?	NoArgument	test
video games				If I go on Wikipedia it says it's "a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society" like Antifa only covers radical and maybe forcible suppression of opposition.	NoArgument	test
video games				It depends if it requires suppression of all ideas or just a small fraction.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course.	NoArgument	test
video games				Wikipedia says fascism is only right wing.	NoArgument	test
video games				That must mean that leftists can use violence to silence opposition and it’s totally not fascism.	NoArgument	test
video games				So let's cut right wing out of the definition.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is still a bunch of stuff in the definition they don't meet.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like you'd have to chop quite literally almost everything out of the definition to get to "Antifa are the real facists" and that's assuming you don't consider suppressing opposition to mean more than just a tiny sliver of your opposition (which I think is needed because otherwise quite literally everything is facist).	NoArgument	test
video games				Like there are criticisms to make against Antifa but you don't sound interested in that when you just make bullshit up.	NoArgument	test
video games				What bullshit am I making up?	NoArgument	test
video games				I said silencing opposition with violence is fascism.	NoArgument	test
video games				That is textbook antifa.	NoArgument	test
video games				If that's your definition of facism then like pretty much all mainstream politics is facism.	NoArgument	test
video games				THATS THE POINT OF THIS FUCKING THREAD.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am not blaming antifa for all of America’s ills.	NoArgument	test
video games				Antifa in my opinion is a product of hyper partisan political bullshit.	NoArgument	test
video games				When it gets to the point that a bunch of people in masks think they need to fucking hurt innocent people who simply think differently than they do ITS TIME TO STOP THIS SHIT	NoArgument	test
video games				You unironically think that almost everyone in politics is a facist?	NoArgument	test
video games				Like that seems like you've stretched the definition of facism to the point that it's no longer usable on your end.	NoArgument	test
video games				I never meant to bring fascism into the conversation.	NoArgument	test
video games				It was never my argument that all politicians are fascists.	NoArgument	test
video games				Simply put once again I think the hyper partisan rhetoric coming from both sides is radicalizing people and it needs to stop.	NoArgument	test
video games				People need to realize that we’re all in this together and we need to stop letting the media and partisan politics tell us that the people we disagree with are our enemies.	NoArgument	test
video games				That’s all.	NoArgument	test
video games				This was never meant to be a left vs right thing.	NoArgument	test

video games				That violence?	NoArgument	test

video games				Being against fascists is not in it of itself fascist.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also see bike lock skull smashings and setting fire to bins and throwing them through Starbucks window, oh and smashing cash machines up.	NoArgument	test
video games				The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have both classified Antifa as terrorists for years now so it beyond debate that they are violent extremists at this point.	NoArgument	test
video games				There you have it folks, some anarkiddie breaking the window of a Starbucks is no different from mass murder.	NoArgument	test
video games				>The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have both classified Antifa as terrorists   If that was actually true, [then why last week would Trump have been saber rattling about classifying them as one?](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-antifa-teror-group-white-supremacy-violent-white-supremacists-a9035106.html)  One would think if they were already classified as a terrorist organization there would be no need for the Pathological Liar in Chief to threaten to classify it as a terrorist org.

video games				your argument falls flat because there is no Antifa organization, it's simply the idea of being against fascism.	NoArgument	test
video games				This in contrast with fascist groups.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those are organized, large scale.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can easily find them.	NoArgument	test
video games				They are black bloc.	NoArgument	test
video games				They all wear the same clothes.	NoArgument	test
video games				That clearly shows a level of organisation, or are you trying to claim it's some massive coincidence that everyone wears the same colour and has their face covered?	NoArgument	test
video games				They also have known presence points on Twitter and Facebook etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those are points of organisation.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think you get what I am trying to say.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no large scale organization that is antifa.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are autonomous individual groups, like the local socialist orgs tend to have an understanding of grouping and organisation, but there is nobody encouraging anything other than being antifascist.	NoArgument	test
video games				Trust me when I say from experience as a leftist that there's way too many disagreements between those groups for there to be anything else in common, I wish that I could tell you your vision of antifa is feasible.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most wear masks because it's a good idea, fascist/alt right groups are great at doxing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Wearing black is a stereotype, some individual groups wear black as a sort of uniform or whatever but it's by no means a rule or anything...	NoArgument	test
video games				At the very least, the groups that don't engage in violence don't denounce the ones that do, so calling them violent or not becomes pretty semantic beyond that point.	NoArgument	test
video games				The FBI considers them a terrorist group and a greater threat currently than white supremacist groups, so organised or not, their threat should be taken seriously.	NoArgument	test
video games				What violence?	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you seriously trying to argue that antifa is completely innocent of violent actions?	NoArgument	test

video games				You can do that in most forms of socialism.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're thinking socialism = government control.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's a narrow view which is akin to saying that corporate hegemony = all capitalism, which is obviously false.	NoArgument	test
video games				Socialism in the vast majority of non-marxist-leninist socialist thought is more about worker control of the means of production and public sharing of land and property (aside from one's own personal property).	NoArgument	test
video games				For example if Amazon was a worker co-op then all of the wealth generated by Amazon would be equally shared amongst it's workers, rather than collected into the hands of an owner, aka Jeff Bezos.	NoArgument	test
video games				No government involved whatsoever.	NoArgument	test
video games				The idea is to shape our market system from one where a select few individuals control all the businesses to one where every worker has an equal share of the business they work for.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only programs socialists within modern western democracies typically want to leave up to a government (and a fairly democratically elected one at that, so it at least reflects the public) is the military, law enforcement, fire departments, public utilities, and healthcare.	NoArgument	test
video games				A lot of these forms of socialism have already been extremely successful over here in Europe.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm part of a workers co-op and earn significantly more money than a worker that is stuck in a corporate job simply because I also get an equal share of the market value of the capital I produce.	NoArgument	test
video games				I completely agree with you on everything I've seen except this last comment.	NoArgument	test
video games				The definition as found on Wikipedia is: Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.	NoArgument	test
video games				So forcible suppression of opposition is the obvious similarity.	NoArgument	test
video games				While, the motive for actual fascists is to obtain power and eliminate opposition, I believe the motive for antifa is to prevent an authoritarian gaining power and tame the opposition (crucially, not eliminate it).	NoArgument	test
video games				Obviously it's a disparate group and some of them want Stalinism, but I think it is unrealistic to say antifa are practicing fascism.	NoArgument	test

video games				Hey, there's bad people on both sides of the spectrum, it just happens to be Republican followers that do more violent acts like school shooting, that's the facts.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then you have Trump who incites violence, yes incites violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sure, maybe there was a couple leftist in the rally, but they weren't attacking the trumpers, quite the opposite the trumpers were attacking them, now you will probably think this is fine but the rest of the world doesn't.	NoArgument	test

video games				It's the opposite, you have to answer the questions of the opposition, this is the part where Trump is called hateful and dangerous, because he baits you trumpeteers into using your firsts instead of brains to answer difficult questions.	NoArgument	test
video games				And don't give me that condemning bullshit, Trump has NEVER Ever condemned the violence his supporters carries out, so stop requiring that of any leftist organisation, you sound incredibly hypocritical when you do that.	NoArgument	test
video games				I also doubt you are stating facts here because there's nothing about cartels fighting US border patrol online, if they did there would be massive outrage because American lives would've been lost, and knowing American foreign policy you would invade Mexico and take care of the cartel yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm ready to be proven wrong on this point however because I didn't do more than 5 min research.	NoArgument	test
video games				There has never been anyone here saying that attacking Republicans is fine, it's actually the opposite, any decent human being condemns ANY attack on anyone, politics is a verbal war, not physical.	NoArgument	test
video games				>it just happens to be Republican followers that do more violent acts like school shooting, that's the facts.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lol what?...	NoArgument	test
video games				No it isn't.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Sure, maybe there was a couple leftist in the rally, but they weren't attacking the trumpers,  Yes they were attacking people, and the police refused to protect them.	NoArgument	test
video games				After that trump had to bring his own security to every event to protect his supporters.	NoArgument	test
video games				>And don't give me that condemning bullshit, Trump has NEVER Ever condemned the violence his supporters carries out  Ummm because his supporter have never commited violence?	NoArgument	test
video games				Ever.	NoArgument	test
video games				>I also doubt you are stating facts here because there's nothing about cartels fighting US border patrol online  Lol, you do realize Google doesn't allow you to see this stuff right?	NoArgument	test
video games				They are on hidden video admitting it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyway type "military exchanges fire with cartels at border" into duck duck go.	NoArgument	test
video games				Dozens of articles going back even a decade pop up.	NoArgument	test
video games				>if they did there would be massive outrage because American lives would've been lost,  Yes you would think so.	NoArgument	test
video games				Perhaps this will be your red pill.	NoArgument	test
video games				Notice how the left only thinks what they are told to think, and are only outraged when they are told to be outraged.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Notice how the left only thinks what they are told to think, and are only outraged when they are told to be outraged.	NoArgument	test
video games				Oh, the irony.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is basically the entire existence of your account; regurgitating far right wing talking points like a loyal dog.	NoArgument	test
video games				"facts" are not talking points.	NoArgument	test
video games				They are verifiable.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cool, verify this then:  >Actually there are a lot of Democrats in the Republican party,	NoArgument	test
video games				I am convinced that you are delusional, I will not continue to argue with someone unwilling to critize their own beliefs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Enjoy your crumbling country.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is this the Reddit equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and shouting "lalalalala"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes you did that to every single point I had so I returned the favor.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no point arguing with a wall.	NoArgument	test
video games				Can I see your examples?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well just off the top of my head  Eric Holder "when they go low we kick them"  Maxine Waters "“If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”  Cory Brooker “Go to the Hill today.	NoArgument	test
video games				Get up and, please, get up in the face of some congresspeople.”.	NoArgument	test
video games				-- note the context here is that this was right after a bunch of conservative politicians were attacked by a mob at a chicken restaurant in washington, so there is no doubt that he knew what he was saying.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then from pundits there is the severed head of Donald Trump.	NoArgument	test
video games				A play about assassinating Donald Trump.	NoArgument	test
video games				CNN running exposes actually glorifying Antifa and painting them as hero's (then when an Antifa member shoots up Dayton they don't even apologize).	NoArgument	test
video games				This is just off the top of my head.	NoArgument	test
video games				Pretty much every time I turn on the television a liberal is calling for violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				It all just becomes a blur.	NoArgument	test
video games				>"When we go low we kick them"  Pretty sure that's a metaphor to play off the strategy they used to have of "When they go low we go high".	NoArgument	test
video games				>Chicken incident  If staff asking people to leave is violence then yeah I guess the left is very violent  >severed head of trump  Sure, this was pretty tasteless and dumb  >a play about assassinating Donald Trump  The one they do literally every year with the current president?	NoArgument	test
video games				If this is violence they must be radical centerists  >CNN glorifying Antifa  Source?	NoArgument	test
video games				So like of all your examples I don't think it's unfair to call most of them stretches.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meanwhile Trump said "If you see someone ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?	NoArgument	test
video games				Seriously, OK?	NoArgument	test
video games				Just knock the hell.	NoArgument	test
video games				I promise you I will pay for your legal fees.	NoArgument	test
video games				I promise, I promise"  "Get him out, try not to hurt him.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you do, I'll defend you in court.	NoArgument	test
video games				Don't worry about it."  If metaphorical violence and getting in people's faces is unacceptable surely this crosses the line in a very major way right?	NoArgument	test

video games				>Okay?	NoArgument	test
video games				It's still encouragung violence  I mean like if you're dumb enough to not notice an obvious metaphor sure I guess?	NoArgument	test
video games				Common sense would dictate they don't actually mean kick them.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Why are you ignoring the fact people got physically attacked?	NoArgument	test
video games				Source for that?	NoArgument	test
video games				>CNN  They had a debate on Antifa and one side had to defend them.	NoArgument	test
video games				You think this means CNN is glorifying antifa?	NoArgument	test
video games				This was probably run alongside an equal amount of talking points sayimg antifa is bad because that's how debates work.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell even the defender says a good amount of their violence is bad.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hardly seems like CNN is glorifying antifa does it?	NoArgument	test
video games				Edit:  But I ask again, if metaphorical violence is unacceptable surely calling for someone to actually get beaten up, and going as far as to say you'll pay the assailants legal fees is worse right?	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				>If that's the route you want to go  Look dude.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree the Trump "he said it jokingly" is bullshit, but like "They go low, we go high" has been a metaphor for the Democrat strategy since Obama.	NoArgument	test
video games				"They go low, we kick them" is an obvious rhetorical spin meant to metaphorize the Democrats should start playing dirty too.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just like how there wasn't a bunch of Democrats jumping whenever a Republican crouched, this is quite obviously not meant to be saying we should literally kick the Republicans when they crouch down.	NoArgument	test
video games				If Trump said something that was that clear of a metaphor I'd say he wasn't literal either.	NoArgument	test
video games				The argument that either we have to take everything literally or we can take nothing literally just doesn't work.	NoArgument	test
video games				>CNN  My point is there are probably just as many clips I could use from that debate to say that you're wrong and CNN actually hates antifa, because like that's how debates work.	NoArgument	test
video games				Saying that they had a debate and one side defended them (which you need if you do a debate) means that CNN is pro-antifa is just like dumb?	NoArgument	test
video games				We could argue that maybe the debate was a bad idea but your claim CNN is glorifying antifa is pretty dumb.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Trump stuff  Fair enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				The original person I was talking to thought Republicans were perfectly innocent and Democrats were super violent.	NoArgument	test

video games				"Try not to hurt him.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you do, I'll defend you in court.	NoArgument	test
video games				Don't worry about it."  - During a rally for Montana Republicans ahead of the midterms, Trump praised Rep.	NoArgument	test
video games				Greg Gianforte, who allegedly body slammed a reporter back when he was initially running for his congressional seat in 2017.	NoArgument	test
video games				>"Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type!"	NoArgument	test
video games				I already replied to this.	NoArgument	test
video games				You are talking about a rally where hundreds of Trump's supporters were attacked, many hospitalized and the man you are describing was attacking people, tearing down their signs and spitting on people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Amazing you can equate telling people to defend themselves being the same as seeking out and attacking people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's assume that's all true (doubtful, but let's go with it) - what about the other 3?	NoArgument	test
video games				It's hard to deny that Trump has ever attempted to take the high road and preach non-violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				Isn't that what you guys constantly praise him for?	NoArgument	test
video games				The first 3 were all the same incident.	NoArgument	test
video games				The last one was joke.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everyone with half a brain knew  that this was fake news and no one body slammed anyone.	NoArgument	test
video games				All conservatives were having a laugh at the idiotic and self obsessed fake news media that was pumping out that nonsense at the time.	NoArgument	test
video games				Wow.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's impressive how everything you said was factually, provably incorrect.	NoArgument	test
video games				The first quote is from Iowa on Feb 1, 2016.	NoArgument	test
video games				The second is from Las Vegas later that month, and the third is from a rally in Michigan.	NoArgument	test
video games				Feel free to verify these for yourself - all it will take is a quick google of each quote.	NoArgument	test
video games				As for Gianforte - he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is an audio recording of the bodyslam and witnesses who testified that:  >"Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground," then "began punching the man."  Gianforte ultimately gave a written apology to the journalist and donated $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists.	NoArgument	test
video games				C'mon man.	NoArgument	test
video games				You talk about fake news, and you're out here spreading misinformation and just making a complete fool out of yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Have some self respect and don't just make things up out of whole cloth.	NoArgument	test

video games				>The first 3 were all the same incident.	NoArgument	test

video games				This is hilarious, thank you	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's see the proof.	NoArgument	test
video games				“Send them back to their shithole countries” Can’t remember who said it or who elected them, maybe you can help me out	NoArgument	test
video games				That's an interesting quote.	NoArgument	test
video games				Shame no one ever said that.	NoArgument	test
video games				>If you’re aggressively opinionated enough to kill mass amounts of people you’re sick in the head  That's mental illness	NoArgument	test
video games				Is every soldier who believes in the war they're fighting mentally ill?	NoArgument	test
video games				no, that's just military brainwashing.	NoArgument	test
video games				a lot of service members have to be rewired to kill.	NoArgument	test
video games				that, compounded with actual killing/death of squadmates, is the reason so many active service members have PTSD.	NoArgument	test
video games				No, it's being a dangerous asshole.	NoArgument	test
video games				Mental illness is diagnosable and treatable.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not arguing that mental illness isn’t a factor.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m saying the media and politicians are giving these people the push to domestic terror	NoArgument	test
video games				But what’s the solution to that that doesn’t go along the road of gun reform and mental illness?	NoArgument	test
video games				toning down the hyperpartisan/inflammatory rhetoric	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s not like there’s a valve in the White House that’ll do that.	NoArgument	test
video games				congress has the power to censure the president as a forewarning for impeachment, but again, the hyperpartisan rhetoric won't allow for that in this climate.	NoArgument	test
video games				So you think every mass shooter is motivated by extreme partisan politics?	NoArgument	test
video games				Does this include, say, the Elliot Rodgers shooting?	NoArgument	test
video games				Obviously there are outliers and strawman arguments to be made from what I said.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let me revise my viewpoint as the vast vast vast vast majority of recent mass shootings have been politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				Elliot Rodgers was a sick incel who started his rampage with stabbings which gun laws would not change (to bring back a small part of my point).	NoArgument	test
video games				But I stand by my statement, that the vast majority of mass shootings of late have been politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thank you for the response	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you have the issue kind of backwards.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hyper partisanship didn’t cause the popularisation of the alt right and far left, the popularisation of the alt right and far left caused hyper partisan ship.	NoArgument	test
video games				There’s not much you can legislate to stop people being white nationalists.	NoArgument	test
video games				They exist, for whatever reason, they have guns, and they want to kill people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gun legislature may not stop groups like The Base from stock piling weapons and organising attacks, but it could very well stop a 19 year old kid who hates Mexicans from getting a gun and shooting nearly 50 people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, people will easily be able to get illegal firearms, and yes there’s nothing that will get rid of the 300,000,000 guns in the US, but shouldn’t we at least try?	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if is prevents one mass shooting, that’s a victory.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can argue the specifics of the gun reform, wether background checks, waiting periods, or outright bans, but the answer remains the same.	NoArgument	test
video games				The issue may be caused by hyper partisan politics, but the solution is gun reform.	NoArgument	test
video games				Fuck that.	NoArgument	test
video games				The goverment wants us to give up our guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				So they will have more control over us.	NoArgument	test
video games				People with guns stop bad people with guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				I will never give mine up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Ok, that’s fair enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				But there is policy that can be implemented that wouldn’t hamper the people’s ability to arm against the government, such as waiting periods, background checks, licenses, and safety classes.	NoArgument	test
video games				This also wouldn’t effect the 300,000,000 guns already owned.	NoArgument	test
video games				You need 1% of the population to fight to mount a successful resistance, not every joe and Tim.	NoArgument	test
video games				If those background checks and licenses are issued by government, I don't see how that enables resistance to government.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also I'm very surprised to see someone on Reddit say "that's fair" to what OP said.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most just dismiss it as paranoia (even though it's historically valid).	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make.	NoArgument	test
video games				It does make the population less able to fight off the government, but since currently that isn’t happening, and it isn’t likely to happen next week, I want to focus more on how guns affect us right now.	NoArgument	test
video games				More power to you.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am not willing to make that sacrifice, but I find your honesty and self awareness refreshing, at least.	NoArgument	test
video games				In what world is inceldom not part of an extreme right wing ideology??	NoArgument	test
video games				This is like saying being a white supremacist isn't political.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the most glaring difference between the US and most other developed nations where gun violence is much lower comes down to firearm access.	NoArgument	test
video games				Divisive partisan politics and obviously mental illness and video games are not unique to the US.	NoArgument	test
video games				This.	NoArgument	test
video games				The rest of the world already knows this, it's just baffling watching the pro gun movement continously defend the guns rights when you got mass shootings every week.	NoArgument	test
video games				Generally the problem with the alt-right specifically (and right-ideologies in general) is that they politicize arbitrary ascribed attributes such as race gender and sexual orientation.	NoArgument	test
video games				This behavior is inherently radicalizing and almost always leads to violence because the "other side" in a political conflict of that nature has no ability to compromise or to find middle ground *because it's who they are and not a damned abstract political issue*.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thus those right-wing ideologies like the alt-right can not seek concessions from the targets of their ire - the only solution their politics will allow them to come to is that *those people need to stop existing*, and that's how we get these right-wing spree shooters.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is why, for instance [*every single mass shooting event in 2018 was in some way linked to white-supremacy*](https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018)  So for these reasons I'm going to have to take issue with your assessment that it is political polarization on "both sides" as it were, and much more a right-wing specific problem due mostly to the way that right-extremists pick their political enemies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hyper-partisan politics are created by media, and games are a media, if you want t blame Fox you need to acknowledge all platforms exist to disseminate not just information but to shape cultures, political polarization makes for drama, one thing about humans is we love our drama, life would be boring without it, so with law trying to build civil peace while media is driving towards civil war, something has to give.	NoArgument	test
video games				>We have a disgusting epidemic of mass shootings which of late have all been politically motivated and the media and partisan politicians who are trying to push an agenda are to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				This, to me, is the crux of misguided both-sidesing.	NoArgument	test
video games				As far as we know, the Dayton shooting was *not* politically motivated.	NoArgument	test
video games				The act of ascribing political motivations to it is in itself a partisan act.	NoArgument	test
video games				You use the fact that "all" recent shootings were politically motivated as an indicator of your view.	NoArgument	test
video games				But this is incorrect.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ll meet you halfway.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s not video games...	NoArgument	test
video games				it’s mental illness and a poor environment watch [this](https://youtu.be/azRl1dI-Cts) video and if that doesn’t convince you well I can’t convince you   P.S I’m here from r/libertarian;)	NoArgument	test
video games				That story breaks my heart.	NoArgument	test
video games				And to be honest I agree that arming teachers isn’t the answer.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe we can talk about armed security to protect America’s school kids.	NoArgument	test
video games				BTW I fucking hate bullying.	NoArgument	test
video games				You’d look at that dude and think he never had a problem with people messing with him.	NoArgument	test
video games				Bullying takes all shapes and sizes and we need to stop that shit where it starts	NoArgument	test
video games				So did I change your view even a little?	NoArgument	test
video games				!delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sickness takes all forms.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not trying to make a one size fits all argument here but more trying to make these people take responsibility for the radicalization they are abetting.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thank you for the story and I will absolutely think more about this aspect of it	NoArgument	test
video games				Thank you	NoArgument	test
video games				Most mass shooters aren't mentally ill though.	NoArgument	test
video games				The FBI says 68% of mass shooters suffer from mental stressors ( which aren’t illnesses but they can lead to them)	NoArgument	test
video games				What do they define as mental stressors?	NoArgument	test
video games				Things like financial strain, lack of fulfillment, pressure from others, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe I'm showing off how fucked I am, but isn't having at least one mental stressor super common?	NoArgument	test
video games				It seems like saying mass shooters experience troubles like everyone else is kind of a useless data point?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well yes everyone has those mental stressors but the main difference is that the shooters are typically dealing with way more intense forms of it and typically are worse at coping with them, so counseling would still help IMO	NoArgument	test
video games				Fair enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm in favor of making mental healthcare along with other healthcare affordable and easy to get.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it'd be a massive boon to society.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm just skeptical that it will fix the school shooter problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or maybe making it so the average person can’t buy a automatic shooting gun	NoArgument	test
video games				The average person can’t buy an automatic weapon.	NoArgument	test
video games				Who told you they could?	NoArgument	test
video games				You need a military-class license to get one and most sellers don’t have one   So We already did that	NoArgument	test
video games				They can't, genius.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you could do a simple google search you would realize they could not.	NoArgument	test
video games				There has never been a leftist mass shooting	NoArgument	test
video games				You’ve said this is a right vs left circlejerk; there are 13 replies.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree with your basic headline, here.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games and mental illness aren’t to blame; they’re not unique to our country.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hyper partisan politics are to blame, to a degree, but not in a way that you’re suggesting.	NoArgument	test
video games				We are unique in how easy it is for our citizens to access weapons of war.	NoArgument	test
video games				Think about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				We don’t send troops into battle with hunting rifles for a reason.	NoArgument	test
video games				We don’t arm our SWAT teams with revolvers for a reason.	NoArgument	test
video games				We reserve weapons of war, officially speaking, for the specific situations which dictates that those weapons are necessary.	NoArgument	test
video games				Contrarily, we allow people to purchase weapons of war from stores and keep them in their homes in the suburbs of our country.	NoArgument	test
video games				In fact, a weapon of war _by design_ is intended to produce a mass casualty incident.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s built for close quarters _combat_, not for shooting bottles in the back yard or paper targets at the range.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s a tool designed to kill efficiently and quickly.	NoArgument	test
video games				And as far as that’s concerned, the mass shooters could be an advertisement for effectiveness of these weapons.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mean, how many shots did the Ohio shooter get off in a minute?	NoArgument	test
video games				Hyper partisan politics are to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				The left gets in its own way too much with gun discussions, and some people on the left need to reconcile that there’s no putting the genie back in the bottle, and that we’ll have guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				The right gets in its own way too much suggesting that civilians need access to these weapons because freedom.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s ludicrous.	NoArgument	test
video games				So at the end of the day, I agree with your subject line, but not the content of what you’ve actually said.	NoArgument	test
video games				And maybe don’t call out a circlejerk when it’s actually just people center-left trying to be reasonable and you disagree.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just to point out that 'leftist' means someone who is left wing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Possibly with anti-capitalist sentiment.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not the left wing version of alt right, that would be antifa or something like that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Divisive and polarised politics exist in many many many countries where guns aren't available to civilians, and they do not have nearly as many mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				American politics really isn't that polarised compared to the rest of the world.	NoArgument	test
video games				People shout a lot about the other side being Nazis or Commies or whatever but the political mainstream in America is varying shades of neoliberalism regardless of who you vote for.	NoArgument	test
video games				There will always be a small number of social outliers who will for whatever reason want to kill people, and they will did whatever excuse they like to satisfy that primal urge.	NoArgument	test
video games				The solution to the mass shooting problem, if one exists, is to limit the ability of those outliers to access firearms.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't know if that is feasible in US just because of how many god damn guns there are and how massive a part of American culture private ownership of guns is, it would be hard to enforce the prohibition of firearms and there would be a massive black market.	NoArgument	test

video games				Every case is different, some could be mental illness and some due to radicalization, the only common factor we can do anything about is their access to guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you are mentally ill, anything can trigger you, same with radicalization.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look at the scientific facts, case by case, dont assume anything.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you seriously think that a mass shooter would “just be a perfectly healthy and functioning human” if extreme politics didn’t exist?	NoArgument	test

video games				\>If you’re aggressively opinionated enough to kill mass amounts of people you’re sick in the head    \> **mental illness aren’t to blame**    I was gonna say this but you said it in a contradiction to yourself.	NoArgument	test

NoArgument	test
video games				Your view only makes sense if we assume that all taboo actions a person can take are treated the same by the brain.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sex and violence are not the same, and we should not assume the brain has the same reactions to them when viewing them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sex is something that most adults are innately drawn to, while violence is not.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence can be exciting, but we don't have the same biological drive to commit violence that we do for sex.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people, at some point in their life, are going to have sex, but most people aren't going to participate in a shoot out or street fight or assassination.	NoArgument	test
video games				Society understands that violence is bad, and there's not a whole lot of grey area there.	NoArgument	test
video games				Viewing someone commit a murder in the context of a video game doesn't remove the taboo of murdering someone - it's still obviously wrong and something you would never participate in.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meanwhile, there's lots of empirical evidence that viewing sex acts normalizes those sex acts.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sex is something people *do* participate in, and viewing things that sexually excite you can create connections in your brain that can lead to you developing certain sexual tastes.	NoArgument	test
video games				So would say that watching porn may motivate someone to have sex, but watching rape porn would not encourage someone to rape because rape is violence and our brain doesn’t have the same reaction to it as sex?	NoArgument	test
video games				You mention that viewing someone commit a murder doesn't remove the taboo of it, but why would viewing someone commit a rape remove the taboo of that?	NoArgument	test
video games				The key point seems to be that sex and violence are not treated the same by the brain, but are both not often sources of gratification?	NoArgument	test
video games				You mention that society understands violence is bad, but I feel like society also understands that sexual violence is bad.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just because society understands that it is bad doesn't stop it from occurring, or else assault and battery wouldn't be such common crimes.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's a lot more to violence than just guns and assassinations, and I would conversely argue that most people are going to be involved in some form of violence at some point in their lives.	NoArgument	test
video games				Additionally, your point seems to be that violence is a driver of adrenaline whereas sex is a driver of euphoria, but then we get into the territory of GTA players who kill prostitutes ingame.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is this a form of violence due to the killing, or is it a form of sexual excitement due to the rape?	NoArgument	test
video games				Why target prostitutes specifically if the goal is adrenaline from killing something - would any random NPC not have worked as well?	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel like there's certainly some form of sexual factor tied into this, which would cause enough of a grey area for me to be hesitant with agreeing that sex and violence are two entirely different things that are treated entirely differently.	NoArgument	test
video games				As a side note, you mention there's lots of empirical evidence.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is a line that I see come up often, but I don't believe I've ever actually seen said evidence - I've seen plenty of studies referenced when it comes to violence, but not as many for sexual fetishes.	NoArgument	test
video games				The difference between porn and video game violence is that porn often blurs the line between what is rape and what isn’t.	NoArgument	test
video games				Murder is obviously murder in a video game, but what is appropriate sexual behavior is not clear in porn.	NoArgument	test
video games				Stuff like choking is fine if both parent sees have agreed to it, but a recent study shows that the prevalence of choking in mostly vanilla porn has made people think that choking is just an ordinary part of sex, when it isn’t if it hasn’t been talked about beforehand.	NoArgument	test
video games				Watching porn or playing violent video games does not encourage people to engage in those kinds of actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't have the stats to back me up, but I think it's safe to say the following:   A non-sexual person will probably not watch a whole lot of porn.	NoArgument	test
video games				A sexual person who watches porn probably won't seek out sex any more than a sexual person who does not watch porn.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thus, watching porn does not make you seek out more sex in real life.	NoArgument	test
video games				Similarly, playing violent video games does not make you seek out more violence in real life.	NoArgument	test
video games				*However*, when put in the situation, we act based on our experience.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm a non-violent person, but if zombies attacked tomorrow and I was forced to pick up a gun and use it, then I would probably draw on my experience from video games as best I could.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would act based on the closest experiences I have.	NoArgument	test
video games				I have no experiences shooting actual guns, so the best I could would be drawing on my video game experience.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the vast majority of a person's sexual experience comes from watching porn, I'd say there is a good chance they're going to try and emulate some of the things they see.	NoArgument	test
video games				*THIS* can be negative.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you watch a lot of a certain kind of porn, then when it comes time to actually seek out and have real-life sex, then you'll probably want to emulate some of that.	NoArgument	test
video games				You'll draw from the only experiences you have.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're comparing two different things.	NoArgument	test
video games				One is an attempt of emulating a skill used in media.	NoArgument	test
video games				The other is taking a moral judgement from media.	NoArgument	test
video games				What you seem to be saying that learning guns is the same equivalent as learning to betray and backstab people to your own advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you likely to do both because both happen in a game, and can reward you for doing it?	NoArgument	test
video games				You've certainly framed it in a different way in pointing out the difference between seeking and actions, but I would argue in the same vein that violent/taboo pornography is more fundamentally rooted in the seeking than the actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				In particular, at least for most of the situations I've specified, the taboo of the pornography comes from the target - for rape, it is with an unwilling participant, for beastiality, it is with an animal, for loli/shota, it is with an underage child.	NoArgument	test
video games				These seem like things that would be determined during the "seeking" step, as they are based around who you have sex with, rather than how you have sex.	NoArgument	test
video games				As such, drawing from experience should not come into play at all - one cannot "emulate" beastiality unless one actively seeks to have sex with an animal.	NoArgument	test
video games				If, as you put it, watching porn does not make you seek out more sex in real life, then I don't see how one could argue that watching more beastiality porn would correspond to seeking out more sex with animals in real life.	NoArgument	test
video games				At best, I think you would argue that they may be more inclined towards fetishistic role-play, but that falls under a different situation entirely and I think most people wouldn't see much of an issue with fetishistic roleplay between two consenting partners.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people do not actively seek out violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				A lot of people actively seek out sex.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not a lot of people actively seek out rape or incest	NoArgument	test
video games				I think there's a bit of a difference here when it comes to porn and video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the subject of porn, the problem is that there's no context provided, and very rarely any guidance.	NoArgument	test
video games				For the most part, a young teenager getting into pornography, is going into by themselves, and they're going to hide the fact that they're doing it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most parents don't figure out that their child is watching pornography until that kid hits like 15/16/17, yet studies show that most young people first view it from like 12 onward.	NoArgument	test
video games				So by the time parents cotton on to what's going on, generally the teenager has already ankle deep in it for a couple of years, and even then the likelihood of a parent speaking to their child about it, providing context and guidance, well the chances aren't great for the most part.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even then, the access that people have to different types of pornography is unparalleled at this point in time.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's freely available as long as you have an ADSL/Mobile phone data pack, and the smarts to type "Big titties" into the Google search bar.	NoArgument	test
video games				Parents aren't prepared for that, kids aren't prepared for that, and it's introduced at a time when most teenagers are only starting to understand sex as more than an abstract concept.	NoArgument	test
video games				They have nobody telling them that it isn't real, or normal, or even illegal in some cases.	NoArgument	test
video games				Videogames are a totally different story.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people don't start out with violent videogames, and when they're getting around to buying them, they have to go through their parents, who will judge whether or not it's appropriate for their child to play those games.	NoArgument	test
video games				They can also provide context, "This isn't real," or "You shouldn't do anything like this in real life."  It's also negating the fact that for most kids, before they ever play a violent videogame, they're more than likely going to see violent movies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Which, not always, but most of the time will portray violence in a semi-realistic manner that shows that it isn't always appropriate, and has real world/real life consequences.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's really nothing hinting toward violent videogames/movies leading to real world violence, movies and games have gotten progressively more violent for the last sixty or so years, and yet violence has been on a downward trend for most of that period.	NoArgument	test
video games				More boys especially are playing violent videogames, and yet rates of violence for men between 14 to 30-ish are at the lowest rates in human existence in western countries.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those are just my thoughts, what do you think?	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree, but I feel like pornography that teenagers get into would be more mainstream and common ones, would they not?	NoArgument	test
video games				A teenager typing in "big naked titties" into Google is not going to find super niche fetish porn involving dogs or amputees - I feel like one has to go down a very dark hole and do a lot of digging before you start to unearth things in that fashion.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would argue that these forms of pornography serve to cater to people that already have a defined fetish, rather than being what they are initially exposed to.	NoArgument	test
video games				I also feel like parental guidance when it comes to videogames is something that doesn't really happen very often.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look at how common the FPS genre is with the young teenager audience.	NoArgument	test
video games				Similarly, look at how many teenagers play M rated games despite the ratings.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, I think your argument towards violent videogames applies just as similarly towards pornography.	NoArgument	test
video games				A quick Google search leads to me to sources which state (if they are to be believed) that sexual violence has *also* been on a downward trend for at least the past 20-30 years.	NoArgument	test
video games				Heck, the first result I get for "sexual assault statistics over time" leads me to a Department of Justice report (https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf), the first page of which includes a chart showing a clear and definite decline of sexual crimes over the past 20 or so years.	NoArgument	test
video games				As such, if we are going off of data, wouldn't this serve to suggest that the two are similar, rather than separate?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you're right to a degree, yes, most of the pornography that teenagers get into will just some mainstream stuff at first.	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem is that there's no gatekeeper to the more extreme stuff.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you were to go on a pornographic video website, something like pornhub because if you type some obvious porn references to Google you'll generally see it somewhere in the top results you might just start with something kinda casual or mainstream.	NoArgument	test
video games				But those websites are a lot like YouTube, in that directly under the video you're playing, they have recommendations, and just like YouTube it's very easy to stray from mainstream fair into more extreme.	NoArgument	test
video games				You start looking at blonds with big boob, then just below that is a video of a different blond doing anal, you click on that, then there are videos of women being choked, assfucked and spat on, then you start seeing rougher sex, faux incest, rape-play, women using anatomically animal dildos, so on so forth.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can find all of that on the most mainstream porn aggregator around.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell, there have even been issues with animated child pornography finding it's way on there.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no paywall, or gatekeeper between videos saying "Look, this is not something that you should be viewing, we need your mother or father to confirm that they're okay with you watching this." When you say "Already defined fetish," it's a problem that it is an already defined fetish, but it's more of a problem that the fetish material is more freely available, to become a child's initial introduction, to plant the seeds for, and eventually foster a full blown fetish.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those sorts of thing don't spring up spontaneously for the most part.	NoArgument	test
video games				On videogames, that's not accurate,the First person shooter genre being popular with teenagers really has nothing to do with a lack of parental guidance or supervision.	NoArgument	test
video games				For violent videogames, as a general rule, most parents will speak with their children about them, there is also a large amount of cultural context provided by TV, school, family/friends that reinforces that being violent in real life is socially unacceptable.	NoArgument	test
video games				Despite that, parents are aware that their children are playing those games, they're usually the ones buying them for their children, or paying for the console/PC/Subscription service.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's a level of overview, that really doesn't exist when it comes to the availability of even the most extreme types of porn that are literally a few choice search terms away from unloading themselves into a barely formed teenagers sexuality.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you can do it all without your parents knowing about it, hell you can do it with a smartphone literally wherever you are in the world.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only thing you need to access porn is a working internet connection, that's really it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Videogames?	NoArgument	test
video games				You're going to be spending bare minimum a thousand dollars for a working gaming computer, five to six hundred for a console, and that's not even including the price of the games themselves.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have to make a conscious effort to purchase the prerequisites, very few parents are going to do that without looking into it.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the statistics, I'd have to disagree with you, there have absolutely been studies done that show video game violence doesn't influence real world violence, and some studies that even suggest it helps curb real world violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the flip side, there are definitely studies that show early sexualization of children puts them at higher risk for sexually risky or harmful behaviour later in life.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's also a much bigger difference between videogames and sexuality and it's effects on the individuals and communities involved.	NoArgument	test
video games				Looking at the statistics of sexual violence without the cultural context which surrounds it, things like feminism, reforms around sex education and law reforms for sexual assault, not to mention the recognition of what constitutes sexual assault being much larger than it ever has been in our society.	NoArgument	test
video games				And I really can't stress this enough, but there is no link that has ever been established linking videogames and violence that didn't come from a biased source.	NoArgument	test
video games				But there is a wealth of information about sexual violence, it's causes, mitigating factors, and the problems surrounding extreme fetishes and their escalation.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's just really not a comparable subject.	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem you are having here, that the mere claim that "media influences people" can cover wildly different actual beliefs.	NoArgument	test
video games				To quote the title of one famous study on media cultivation theory (that's specific fin findings are not 100% relevant here):  "**Some genres have some effects on some viewers**"    This is essentially an axiom of media studies.	NoArgument	test
video games				The entire conceit behind the existence of advertising, political propaganda, edutainment, and so on, is that what media you are exposed to, can indeed influence your behavior.	NoArgument	test
video games				The same applies whenever you hear anecdotes about how taking martial arts classes became popular among kids after Karate Kid came out, or that Uncle Tom's Cabin has popularized abolitionist sentiment back in the 1850s, those are examples of this axiom being taken for granted as fairly sensible.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the other hand, the idea that media can predictably and measurably brainwash individuals to "make them do things", is an extreme interpretation of an [already outdated model of communication theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle_model).	NoArgument	test
video games				The "video games cause violence" crowd almost exclusively consists of people pushing for the latter.	NoArgument	test
video games				Criticism of pornography can also have an element of that, but it also leaves room for a more nuanced discussion about the nature of normalization.	NoArgument	test
video games				You see, media normalization doesn't really mean that once you see an action on a screen you will automatically try to imitate it, just that eventually you might take it granted as a part of your world.	NoArgument	test
video games				Action movies where cars explode if you fire a handgun at them didn't make people fire guns at cars en masse, but it did make many of them internalize the presumption that this is what really *would happen* if they tried.	NoArgument	test
video games				It didn't manipulate them into doing something counterintuitive, but it did seep into their understanding of an event that they only ever see in the TV, being plausible because why not?	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if you regularly consume violent media, and it does influence you to perceive the world as more violment than someone who doesn't, that don't necessarily make you more violent.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example if you are a bit of a coward, you might simply be more afraid of violence lurking behind every corner.	NoArgument	test
video games				With porn, the concern is that so much of it is so rapey, and so many teenagers, it makes up a huge chunk of everything they ever learned about sex before actually doing it.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think violence and taboo sexual acts are somewhat different.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are many instances in our society where violence is acceptable.	NoArgument	test
video games				People attack each other for sport.	NoArgument	test
video games				People shoot animals for fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				People go to war and join the army.	NoArgument	test
video games				People own guns to defend themselves.	NoArgument	test
video games				The concept of violence in and of itself is not taboo; mass shootings and gruesome violence are.	NoArgument	test
video games				But are there any mass shooting video games where people derive pleasure from pretending to shoot up schools?	NoArgument	test
video games				No.	NoArgument	test
video games				Similarly, people have sex all the time.	NoArgument	test
video games				“Liberal” people do not have issues with most kinds of porn, generally.	NoArgument	test
video games				That said, porn that specifically recreates some of the most taboo sexual acts (such as pedophilia) is something that doesn’t have a parallel in video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				There aren’t any video games where you sit and torture people slowly over the course of hours and then have sex with their dead bodies.	NoArgument	test
video games				There aren’t any video games where you break into your parents’ safe, take their guns, and then go to school to shoot as many people as possible.	NoArgument	test
video games				But there IS porn where people have sex with dead bodies or with children.	NoArgument	test
video games				And that kind of act is never acceptable anywhere in our society	NoArgument	test
video games				Is it not a common joke that people go on violent killing sprees in video games for enjoyment?	NoArgument	test
video games				If not, then what would you call the Skyrim quick-saving meme, where people quick save, mass kill various NPCs, and then load to reset?	NoArgument	test
video games				What would you call indiscriminate violence in GTA games?	NoArgument	test
video games				What would you call games like Gorn, which center around intense gore and gruesomely exaggerated body parts flying around as you rip your opponents apart in a spray of blood?	NoArgument	test
video games				I would actually tend to argue that there are far more mainstream videogames which allow for exaggerated and intense violence than there is mainstream pornography which involves taboo actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's important to remember that taboo/fetishistic pornography is a very niche thing that generally only exists if one deliberately seeks them out, and comparing that against mainstream videogames with less exaggerated violence would be a bit of a false equivalency.	NoArgument	test
video games				Overly violent videogames centered around mass shootings and gruesome violence certainly *do* exist, and that would be the corresponding comparison with taboo pornography.	NoArgument	test
video games				Context and purpose matter.	NoArgument	test
video games				A video game where you run around with a sword, fighting dragons, but where you have the *option* of killing people indiscriminately, is very different than a game designed to replicate the experience of being a school shooter.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even something like GTA offers more enjoyment than simply killing indiscriminately.	NoArgument	test
video games				While you *can* choose to go around mass murdering everyone, and may even do so for a moment because of its novelty, ultimately the gameplay revolves around driving, completing storyline quests, and achieving goals.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meanwhile, taboo porn exists for the sole purpose of arousing people by depicting taboo sexual acts which they enjoy.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no other purpose or value to the works.	NoArgument	test
video games				Pedophilia is not a side-effect or potential course of action in child porn: it is the entirety of the work.	NoArgument	test
video games				That’s the difference between porn and say, Lolita, which also features pedophilia but offers other value, perspectives, and interpretations.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would argue if someone released a game that had no story, no side quests, and the only gameplay was to buy guns and shoot children at a school, people *would* be up in arms about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				That would be the violence equivalence of taboo pornography.	NoArgument	test
video games				> A video game where you run around with a sword, fighting dragons, but where you have the option of killing people indiscriminately, is very different than a game designed to replicate the experience of being a school shooter.	NoArgument	test
video games				But there are several video games out there that are exactly what you're describing here, like *Hatred* (in which you are literally a spree killer and the goal of the game is to kill as many innocents as possible) and *Postal 2* (which is banned in New Zealand and merely possessing the game can net you 10 years in prison).	NoArgument	test
video games				So in this case, are you saying that as long as the taboo content is not the sole purpose of the work, then it would be considered to be okay?	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's take an example scenario - there exists a genre of videogames in Japan known as "visual novels", many of which are pornographic and/or erotic in nature.	NoArgument	test
video games				Many of them have been translated into English, but this genre is far larger in Japan than it is elsewhere.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some of these games may be entirely pornographic in intent and purpose, but many of them exist as a form of literary story-telling where the purpose of the game is in the story, rather than that the content.	NoArgument	test
video games				As you put it, the *context* and the *purpose* of these games is more than simply pornographic content.	NoArgument	test
video games				These visual novels generally contain multiple characters which you can romance, and in many of these games, one (or more) of these characters will be a loli.	NoArgument	test
video games				In this scenario, the game contains loli content, but is not focused around it - similar to your point regarding GTA, while you can choose to romance the loli character in this game, the fundamental gameplay revolves around the story and the characters.	NoArgument	test
video games				The loli content is not crucial to the game, and can be easily ignored if you wish to do so.	NoArgument	test
video games				In this case, would you agree that the loli content is okay, or would you consider it unacceptable?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would you argue that the game itself is the problem, would you believe that the content should be removed, or would you think the game is fine as-is?	NoArgument	test
video games				If your answer to the previous question was the first or second option, then what makes it different from games that allow mass murder?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would you agree that for many people, the answer to that question would be different than the answer to the same question in regards to GTA or Skyrim?	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe that many, if not most, people I know would argue for the second option - that is, that since loli content is unacceptable, then it should be removed from a game that contains it.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, why then does this argument not apply to similar games with mass murder?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would it not be reasonable to draw the obvious parallel; that is, since mass murder is unacceptable, then it should be removed from a game that contains it?	NoArgument	test
video games				I do not believe that indiscriminate mass murder is a fundamental and indispensable aspect to making Skyrim or GTA a good game, and as such, I believe that removing the ability to do so would not destroy the game as we know it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why, then, does nobody advocate for doing so, while advocating for loli/rape/beastiality to be removed from games containing it?	NoArgument	test
video games				> But are there any mass shooting video games where people derive pleasure from pretending to shoot up schools?	NoArgument	test
video games				No.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are.	NoArgument	test
video games				One got pulled from Steam last year.	NoArgument	test
video games				Another is available online right now, based on Columbine.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well it got pulled from Steam, didn't it?	NoArgument	test
video games				Which makes it seem like people aren't exactly coming out in droves to support it...	NoArgument	test
video games				It did get pulled from Steam, and now it, like the others, is available online just not on the Steam platform.	NoArgument	test
video games				People coming out in droves to support them wasn't your initial premise.	NoArgument	test
video games				There _are_ games where people derive pleasure from shooting up schools.	NoArgument	test
video games				And to add on to the previous:  >There aren't video games where you sit and torture people slowly over the course of hours and then have sex with their dead bodies  Custer's Revenge (NES) - Dodge arrows as you make your way to the Native American woman tied to a cactus.

video games				Sex!	NoArgument	test
video games				(Whether she's a willing participant or a rape victim isn't made clear)  [Soldier of Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_of_Fortune_\(video_game\)) (PC, Dreamcast, PS2)  >The game was notable for its realistic depictions of violence, made possible by the GHOUL engine, including the dismemberment of human bodies.	NoArgument	test
video games				This was the game's stylistic attraction and it caused considerable controversy, especially in British Columbia and Germany, where it was classified as a "pornographic film" and listed on the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, respectively.	NoArgument	test
video games				The technology creates 26 different zones on the bodies of enemies, allowing for vastly different reactions depending upon which one is targeted.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nonviolence is also possible, if the player can aim well enough to disarm enemies.	NoArgument	test
video games				[Silent Hill: Homecoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill:_Homecoming) (PC, PS3, XBox 360)  >Was banned and refused to get a rating in Australia and Germany for extreme violence and disturbing images which included graphic sexuality, copious blood spray in the game, decapitations, partially dismembered corpses, and numerous scenes of attacks, fights, torture and death  Saw - the game based on the movies, which includes dissecting an human body to retrieve a key.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, none of those _quite_ fits the exact description of "torture for hours and then have sex with the bodies", but "torture porn" isn't exactly a stranger to the video game scene.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m sure many of the people who dislike taboo porn would also dislike these torture porn games.	NoArgument	test
video games				They’re not widespread or popular games.	NoArgument	test
video games				And again, these topics are extreme and unpleasant but not taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				Pedophilia IS taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Pedophilia IS taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				I remember the Olsen twins "countdown to their 18th birthday websites and the jailbait subreddit.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, there is some taboo about pedophilia, but there are plenty of people trying to normalize the idea that "men are biologically programmed to be attracted to pubescent children".	NoArgument	test
video games				I assume you saw the kefluffle the last couple days over Richard Stallman leaving MIT and the FSF.	NoArgument	test
video games				He was an open advocate for "consensual pedophilia" for about 15 years.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hero of the open source software community, pedophilia advocate.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's a taboo, but it's not as universal as you make it sound.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t know much about either instance you gave, but two instances of people violating a social taboo doesn’t make it not taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you won’t agree that pedophilia is taboo in our society, then I think the term is pretty meaningless because I’m not aware of many more taboo topics than that.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think consensual incest should allowed, and I’ve heard other people express the same opinion, but you won’t see me bringing that up at a party, because it’s incredibly taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				On the other hand, I would absolutely discuss the most recent GTA game or Saw movie and no one would be horrified by the mention of the topic, even if they express distaste for the content.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I don’t know much about either instance you gave, but two instances of people violating a social taboo doesn’t make it not taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				There were at least [7 different websites with such a countdown](https://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Celebrity-18th-birthday-countdowns-have-long-been-1148050.php), and plenty of stories in the media about their birthday.	NoArgument	test
video games				The jailbait subreddit had 800,000 subscribers when it finally got media attention and was shut down.	NoArgument	test
video games				Richard Stallman is one of the most famous names in Computer Science, and had his apologia for pedophilia in plan view on his web page.	NoArgument	test
video games				I understand and agree that many people would consider pedophilia a taboo subject, but it's _not_ universally agreed upon, and there are also many people who see nothing wrong with advocating for it, in public.	NoArgument	test
video games				Literally nothing is universally agreed upon.	NoArgument	test
video games				I will clarify that the definition of pedophilia I’m using here is attraction to *pubescent or pre-pubescent children,* not attraction to sexually mature young adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				However unfavorably people look on attraction to 16/17 year olds, it’s not taboo in the way attraction to small children is.	NoArgument	test
video games				If under that definition you still disagree  that pedophilia is taboo in the United States, there’s really no point in having this conversation, because if the idea of having sex with small children isn’t taboo I don’t know what is.	NoArgument	test
video games				When you play a video game you're stimulated by its visuals and audio, the actions you're making with a controller are significantly disconnected from the actions registered in a game.	NoArgument	test
video games				When someone watches porn they're stimulating themselves to an orgasm, usually, and that's enough of a difference that I don't believe the two experiences have the same impact psychologically.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's a solid argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video game violence is abstract and disconnected from your actual actions, porn is way closer to what you're doing with your body.	NoArgument	test
video games				Until you've had sex, everything you know about sex comes from pornography.	NoArgument	test
video games				By contrast, any child knows a lot about the real world from experience other than video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyone playing Wolfenstein 3d **knows** there aren't a bunch of Nazi Zombies running around, but some people may legitimately think that all woman like having men ejaculate on their faces.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm trying to think of a video game that is comparable, like maybe a flight simulator or something but it's rare that our primary experiences of the world for any given part of the world come from games whereas people getting the majority of their sex experience from porn is all too common.	NoArgument	test
video games				Taboo does not mean illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most ‘taboo’ things you see on a porn site are perfectly legal when occurring between two consensual adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence, in almost all cases, is illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a clear difference between the two mindsets.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no good reason why consenting adults can’t do a bunch of taboo sex stuff, and many many reasons why a person will not commit random acts of violence no matter what media they’ve consumed.	NoArgument	test
video games				Have rates of incest gone up recently?	NoArgument	test
video games				If you look at pornhub, you'd definitely think so.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m curious how large a role others believe the uncanny valley plays in this situation.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your comparison may not be correct in the eyes of a lot of users.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m assuming most will sight that the bridge between the realism of games and porn are to very different distances across and a more appropriate comparison would be between those that seek videos of real violence with human players and not digital ones.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or further comparing violent video games and pornographic ones or videos of real violence and real pornography.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t believe they are comparable and is likely the common view.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why would the distances be different in each scenario?	NoArgument	test
video games				People seeking videos of real violence against actual humans would be akin to people seeking pornographic videos of illegal actions against real people - as I mentioned, this is an entirely different issue and I believe this to be entirely wrong regardless of the situation.	NoArgument	test
video games				My argument concerns only the scenarios of an entirely digital video game, where all violence occurs using fictional characters towards fictional characters, and entirely digital pornography, where all sexual actions occur between fictional characters.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the argument is that videogames and videos are two different mediums, then I have no issues changing the specificity of my statement towards pornographic videogames rather than pornography in general, though I don't believe it'd make much of a difference - in my experience, the issue people have is towards pornography in general, regardless of whether it is a video, a drawing, or a videogame.	NoArgument	test
video games				The difference is perspective and intent of the individual.	NoArgument	test
video games				For gaming, it's typically about obtaining the feelings of completion, winning, and sometimes the thrill of the tense situation.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is almost never about wanting to hurt it kill.	NoArgument	test
video games				With porn, the clear feeling one is trying to obtain is arousal and orgasm.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are several studies that show it changes parts of the brain too.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I feel the idea that porn promotes these negatives is not based on factual evidence either.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's more about what the actors possibly go through.	NoArgument	test
video games				That or how the ignorant try to mimic what they see in porn.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is nothing illogical about thinking one affects people differently or leads to different behaviors, as they are different activities.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, you can take issue with arguments made about them, but your title view is not specific to those.	NoArgument	test
video games				>  The prevailing argument seems to be that pretty much everyone is able to distinguish fiction from reality  So....	NoArgument	test
video games				is your issue with *this* argument or is it with the belief that for whatever reason one is different than the other?	NoArgument	test
video games				People aren't limited to this argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games are distinct in many ways - they're not recording live people and the player is interacting with the situations depicting and not just observing them for examples.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is certainly true that they are both fictional, so saying people do/don't distinguish fiction wouldn't explain why they'd affect people differently.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that is hardly the whole story, because it only looks at one similarity and not their various differences.	NoArgument	test
video games				My issue is with the belief that one is different than the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				What would change if my argument specified "digital pornographic games" rather than "digital pornography"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would your claim still hold merit, seeing as any argument towards a videogame would also apply towards a pornographic videogame?	NoArgument	test
video games				What would change if my argument specified "violent movies" rather than "violent videogames"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would your claim still hold merit, seeing as any argument towards a video would also apply towards a violent video?	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm essentially looking to be convinced that fictional sex and fictional violence are fundamentally different and should be treated in different ways - I think the form of the media that they are presented in is irrelevant	NoArgument	test
video games				> Would your claim still hold merit, seeing as any argument towards a videogame would also apply towards a pornographic videogame?	NoArgument	test
video games				That they are distinguishable means one can potentially affect people differently still, so by distinguishing one as pornographic you allow my claim to retain merit.	NoArgument	test
video games				The question then becomes what is "pornographic" exactly.	NoArgument	test
video games				> What would change if my argument specified "violent movies" rather than "violent videogames"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would your claim still hold merit, seeing as any argument towards a video would also apply towards a violent video?	NoArgument	test
video games				My claim would again retain its merit, but of course I would have different differences to point out to.	NoArgument	test
video games				A violent movie of course is different from a non-violent one.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I'm essentially looking to be convinced that fictional sex and fictional violence are fundamentally different and should be treated in different ways  Since violence and sex are different, they are different.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, since they are distinguishable you already presuppose their difference.	NoArgument	test
video games				But we are talking also about depictions of these acts.	NoArgument	test
video games				In a video game we go beyond depiction and are allowed to vicariously act them out to an extent via controlling a character.	NoArgument	test
video games				As we are in all of these cases dealing with different things, then someone can make a case that their differences affect people differently.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is thus not necessarily illogical to think that one may lead to normalization or taboo actions or whatever - we have to deal with the other facts about the arguments, as merely believing two similar things affect people differently isn't illogical.	NoArgument	test
video games				Similar =/= same.	NoArgument	test
video games				Effectively what you're trying to say is it's illogical to believe two things similar in *some ways* lead to different outcomes.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is not the case since they can still be different in other respects, and those differences of course may lead to different outcomes.	NoArgument	test
video games				One fundamental difference is desire.	NoArgument	test
video games				While there are some who desire/crave violence in and of itself...that is few and far between.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence, by its nature, is taking pleasure away from someone by causing pain/injury/etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sex is pleasurable (presumably) by both parties involved.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is a behavior that is craved and sought out by nearly everyone.	NoArgument	test
video games				The desire for sex is a biological...instinctive drive that drives people and animals to extreme behaviors to acquire it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence is, more often than not, a tool used to acquire a desire.	NoArgument	test
video games				Two males in the wild fighting over 'mating rights' to the females being an example.	NoArgument	test
video games				Drug cartels are dangerous because they use brutal violence to protect their operation.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence isn't their goal...it is a means to an end.	NoArgument	test
video games				Excepting the sadists of the world, violence is only ever a means to another end.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sex is often that end.	NoArgument	test

video games				Hi there - you put your point well, and yes there seems to be a certain contradiction.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its hard to say both that Games Dont Cause Violence, but Porn Causes Rape (or rape culture...)  I can’t easily reconcile these two points, but here’s how I see it.	NoArgument	test
video games				By the way, i’m a mid 30s guy who played a lot of games through life.	NoArgument	test
video games				Games don’t rewire your brain towards violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, i think they rewired my brain in some pretty powerful ways.	NoArgument	test
video games				I get frustrated easily by complex problems with no clear solution.	NoArgument	test
video games				If faced with a hard research problem, for example, i’ve found myself thinking stuff like “this is obviously a badly designed level, the code is broken” and i ragequit.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ve craved novelty (new grenades?) and progress (level ups) in tasks that don’t really have novelty and progress built into them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lacking those little dopamine hits has caused me to get frustrated and lose jobs.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t think porn has made me a rapist any more than Metal Gear made me a mass shooter.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I won’t discount the possibility that porn git inside my brain too, somehow.	NoArgument	test
video games				I have certainly heard younger guys talk about sex and how hard it is to cum unless the girl is doing something really, really “porn-ish”.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sometimes they can only cum by their own hand.	NoArgument	test
video games				So i dunno, maybe i didnt change your view as such but hopefully said enough to engage you on some level.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cheers!	NoArgument	test
video games				This is coming from what I've learned in my AP Psych class.	NoArgument	test
video games				Both of these things lead to increases in violence, just different forms.	NoArgument	test
video games				Watching pornography can increase sexual aggression or you normalizing sexual aggression, and violent video games (specifically violent ones) leads you to be more aggressive and exhibit aggressive behavior.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, obviously this isn't true for everyone, but generally speaking we model the things we see.	NoArgument	test
video games				BUT, saying something increases aggression is very general.	NoArgument	test
video games				Obviously something like a fist fight or an argument is different than a shooting, but all three have something to do with aggression.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not sure if this is will change your view in any way, but I think it's important to keep in mind that all visual stimuli has some form of effect on us, regardless of if we can tell fact from fiction.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not illogical because they're two different things, so it could be the case.	NoArgument	test
video games				What's illogical is assuming that it's the case without evidence, because it sure looks like it needs evidence.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hi /u/ecigquestion, Let me know what you think of this angle of approach.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ve understood the post and your reasoning on the issue, I’ve been working this out for quite some time too, it’s the question of taboo and why such things are deemed as taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is this logical aspect of the issue, but it really depends on what you mean by logical.	NoArgument	test
video games				Logic is only as good as the lens it’s seen through, there are some deeply concerning issues when basing the structure of your worldview on something like pure rationality.	NoArgument	test
video games				When we deem something as taboo, we say it is based on its correlation to practices or mindsets that can lead one to act out evil actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, that’s not exactly the main concern although that is what people tend to argue.	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem is much deeper than the arguments being brought forth and language can delve into metaphor at this level of extraction.	NoArgument	test
video games				To simply say that one thing doesn’t affect reality because it’s not real is the logical viewpoint, but to say that the individual is not benefiting from the material is a moral viewpoint.	NoArgument	test
video games				Morality doesn’t come entirely from a purely rational abstraction of the argument, it comes from multiple levels of interpretation based on various ways of looking at the problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would say your argument fails to look anywhere outside of a purely rational viewpoint.	NoArgument	test
video games				Society is incomprehensibly complex and our cultures are barely struggling to allow people to interact with others without actually knowing them, so by pressing against taboo based on limited factors is destroying its foundational principles.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you agree on the majority of the above then it really does come down to how our culture works, in Japan, it’s normal to be looked down on as someone who is obsessed with anime let alone one's personal fetishes.	NoArgument	test
video games				To say that kind of impact is not going to be amplified in a western culture is also a serious issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				All I’m arguing here is that some things are not just taboo because people are ignorant or bigoted, there’s a much greater structure of complexity underneath the fear of a taboo.	NoArgument	test
video games				When you shoot people in an FPS, you usually don't get pleasure from how they cower, bleed, and die slowly.	NoArgument	test
video games				In reality people don't just immediately drop dead after getting shot in the heart, they don't mechanically run behind covers, they aren't trained soldiers and you aren't on a mission.	NoArgument	test
video games				The point of these games isn't to show real life situations and realistic suffering, but rather to give you some "intelligent" moving obstacles to overcome.	NoArgument	test
video games				The violence itself is often abstracted away e.g.	NoArgument	test
video games				in the form of Health Points.	NoArgument	test
video games				When you watch porn, it is the other way, you are immersed in the sexual act itself, how it plays out, what the people pictured feel and how they behave.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is created on purpose in a way that makes the barrier between you and the sex violence perpetrator very thin and tries to make the situation as "realistic" as possible.	NoArgument	test
video games				As a result it's way easier to mirror these behaviors in reality, try to apply them to real people.	NoArgument	test
video games				(To be clear: I _do_ think that when you take away the abstraction from the video games, and make them actually realistic, e.g. a game where you are a school shooter and children behave, bleed and suffer in a super realistic way, then they _will_ normalize violence and _can_ lead to violent behavior. I _do_ believe there potentially can be a symmetry between the two, but currently games with realistic violence aren't very popular, while porn with realistic violence is extremely popular.)	NoArgument	test
video games				It's an improper comparison.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games, generally speaking, depict fictional characters made using computer graphics.	NoArgument	test
video games				The violence in such games is not being carrier out on real people and the player intrinsically understands this.	NoArgument	test
video games				Assuming you are not mentally ill and can distinguish fantasy from reality, this does not lead violence being normalized against other real humans.	NoArgument	test
video games				Pornography, on the other hand, is usually very real.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is a direct recording of real humans having intercourse.	NoArgument	test
video games				In that sense it can normalize things for the viewer.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, there is nothing inherently wrong with such normalization if it is consensual and not harmful.	NoArgument	test
video games				"Fake" pornography (Hentai/Doujinshi/etc) is more comparable to video games in this sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, Loli/shota does not normalize pedophilia because the viewer can tell it is obviously not a real child.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a lot of outcry against it because real pedophilia is so (rightfully) taboo, but that outcry is in the same category as the (wrongful) outcry against violent games.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no such thing as violent video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				No violence has ever befallen pixels.	NoArgument	test
video games				They don't suffer pain nor injury.	NoArgument	test
video games				The same standard has to apply for porn.	NoArgument	test
video games				People do not always perform actions they see on tv.	NoArgument	test
video games				Violence mostly does not require consent.	NoArgument	test
video games				With sex you can get consent to perform actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				This strikes me as a similar argument that you sometimes get with pick-up sports, and it all centers on how competitive everyone is treating the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a very much informal code of conduct regarding behavior/etiquette in any game you play.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you play a pick-up basketball game and are boxing people out, throwing double  teams at people, and calling touch fouls, you're not technically doing anything wrong but you're also not going to make any friends.	NoArgument	test
video games				All of those strategies/techniques are things that are regularly employed in competitive versions of the same game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is very much in the same vein.	NoArgument	test
video games				It can certainly be an effective strategy, but it is also a profoundly unfun strategy to play against, particularly if you're an inexperienced player and don't know the strategies to combat it.	NoArgument	test
video games				So if you're in a casual queue and looking to screw around with some friends, it can suck to go up against someone who is being super competitive.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if you're in a competitive queue, then by all means use any strategy that is within the scope of the rules.	NoArgument	test
video games				Speaking of pick-up sports.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's almost an unwritten rule that if you notice you are way better than the other side that you start handicapping yourself to make the game closer.	NoArgument	test
video games				You stop putting a hand up when they shoot, you give them easier lines to the basket, you stop stealing the ball.	NoArgument	test
video games				All because everyone is there to have fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everyone involved KNOWS you could blow them out, but ultimately it's better to have fun and bring in more regulars who want to play.	NoArgument	test
video games				You never know, they could eventually get pretty good if they play enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then everyone is having more fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is also why most online multiplayer "vs" games have both casual and ranked/competitive modes.	NoArgument	test
video games				A lot of people aren't necessarily in it to win while going all out.	NoArgument	test
video games				>For some reason it’s considered to be an unholy sin to lay in wait for another player.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think the opinion among gamers is that it's morally wrong to camp, it's more the fact that it's annoying to be killed by something you can't see and have no warning of.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think that's what OP is getting at.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's like when someone loses at a game and says "you're cheating".	NoArgument	test
video games				They're just mad that they got played in a way they weren't expecting.	NoArgument	test
video games				In tactical shooters like Squad, Arma, or Escape from Tarkov the goal is to take out the enemy before they even see you because return fire is super lethal.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those are the games where it drives me nuts where people complain about camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, agreed.	NoArgument	test
video games				But isn’t that the point.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sports, war, video games...don’t let them see you coming.	NoArgument	test
video games				I keep coming back to (American) football.	NoArgument	test
video games				A trap play is a simple, common example...you go forward and a pulling guard blasts you from the side and the RB goes right by you.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s annoying as heck to be “deceived” and not see the dude coming to block you.	NoArgument	test
video games				And it’s effective.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Precisely to the degree it’s unexpected).	NoArgument	test
video games				And FWIW, pulling lineman was often considered to be “unsportsmanlike”.	NoArgument	test
video games				Especially when you were supposed to line up against you opposite man and just beat him head to head.	NoArgument	test
video games				Subterfuge in games is almost always poorly (initially) received.	NoArgument	test
video games				>war, video games...don’t let them see you coming  But even in war there are social restrictions (such as the treatment of prisoners or civilians).	NoArgument	test
video games				This is true, but those examples are about lowering the externalities of war.	NoArgument	test
video games				It would be weird to tell a soldier they couldn't camp because the opponent finds it annoying.	NoArgument	test
video games				But evern in war, everything isn't fair game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not like OP is suggesting.	NoArgument	test
video games				And isn't killing civilians camping?	NoArgument	test
video games				Killing potential threats before they have the chance to become so?	NoArgument	test
video games				>your job is to frustrate/surprise your opponent.	NoArgument	test
video games				I disagree with this as a general rule.	NoArgument	test
video games				This comes from the mindest that games are meant to be won, and this is certainly true in **some** circumstances (ESports being the obvious example).	NoArgument	test
video games				However, I would argue that, at least as often, games are meant to be **enjoyed**.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you are using a mechanic that makes the game not enjoyable for the other players, then I would claim that you aren't doing what you should be doing.	NoArgument	test
video games				To put more bluntly, if I was playing a game with someone who kept using a mechanic that frustrated me to the point where I wasn't enjoying the game anymore, I would stop playing.	NoArgument	test
video games				If camping is the only way you have fun in those kinds of games, then fine, you should probably play with other people.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if you \*also\* enjoy other strategies, and refuse to use them because the annoying one is better, it can suck the fun out of a game.	NoArgument	test
video games				> 3) which relates to a larger point....your job is to frustrate/surprise your opponent. Why in goodness name “should” you run out to meet your opponent on a “fair” battleground? If they want/expect a battle in open field, you fight them in the trees, if they want to battle on horseback, you run them into a marsh, and so on. “Come fight me where I expect in the way I expect” doesn’t hold much weight with me.    Is that your job? Or is it to have fun?   Games rely on a common set of social rules between players. If everyone agrees camping is fine, then it’s fine. If people are operating from different sets of social rules, it creates a problem.  I don’t know if you know of the old N64 game “goldeneye” but it was a split screen first person shooter game. Two of the social rules that needed to be discussed were:  1) Is it ok to kill an unarmed person?   2) Is it ok to look at another player’s screen?	NoArgument	test
video games				In a “do anything to win” perspective, the answer to both is yes.	NoArgument	test
video games				However from a fun-maximizing perspective, it’s less clear.	NoArgument	test
video games				To add to this, it was a dick move to pick oddjob because shooting that tiny piece of shit was way harder and gave a clear advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Games rely on a common set of social rules between players  Video games do not.	NoArgument	test
video games				They instead have a means to explicitly codify and strictly enforce rules, as well as deincentivize behavior they would like to be less prevalent.	NoArgument	test
video games				The example you giving is essentially "house rules" and only makes sense in the context of old console games where there were no live updates.	NoArgument	test
video games				Modern video games have carefully curated gameplay that is frequently and very deliberately tweaked by the dev teams.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you don't like someone doing something that is explicitly allowed in game, then you don't like the game...literally don't hate the player hate game.	NoArgument	test
video games				The social contract in this case is between each player and the game itself, not with other players.	NoArgument	test
video games				If I give an example of a social rule present on a 'modern video game with live updates' will you award a delta?	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you hostage negotiating for a delta?	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm asking if you are here to change your view or not.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no requirement for you to do so, and I'm here to provide the service of helping people change views.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you don't want to change your view (if that's not what draws you here), then it would be counterproductive for me to try to offer a service you don't want.	NoArgument	test
video games				At the same time if you are, we should establish what view you have and how to go about changing it to provide good service.	NoArgument	test
video games				I didn't express a view, I expressed a counterargument to the one that you presented.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm interested in exploring social dynamics in modern games, but not interested in deliberately being hemmed in so that you can farm a delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				Clearly it's camping a delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				Actually one of the big problems here is that because neither of us are OP, neither of us have any requirement to argue in good faith or espouse a view we actually hold/are willing to change.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm fine with trying to change views, but I don't want to get into a position where both of us are interlocuting from positions that we don't agree with/care about  (or whatever the right word is)m and the conversation spins in circles.	NoArgument	test
video games				Would you agree with the statement that "everything it is possible to do in a game, it is X to do in a game" where X includes a value like "fair" or "correct" or something?	NoArgument	test
video games				if so, fill in X that you feel represents your view.	NoArgument	test
video games				elaborating on game mechanics being a large factor, I think it depends if the characters have certain powers: Apex (or even Overwatch) characters each have different ults, for example I find Bloodhound a good "camping" character, with Mirage a good flanker; but in PUBG it matters what equipment you have and thus camping might be more frowned upon  but then this brings up another problem: is camping okay in a game like Destiny?	NoArgument	test
video games				in all technicalities, each character has different ults and abilities and gear but I get obscenely annoyed with campers, despite us being similar level/power/abilities.	NoArgument	test
video games				and then there's the other problem that everything is considered camping now adays; defending a point in a strategically hidden spot?	NoArgument	test
video games				well, you're camping!!	NoArgument	test
video games				sitting in a hidden spot to avoid confrontation and get backstabbing kills?	NoArgument	test
video games				camping!!	NoArgument	test
video games				I do think camping can be a strategy, but I also think it's a bit of a cop out to good gameplay	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you and I mostly agree.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the gameplay constraints is a criticism of the game design (or (expression of a limitation if not “flaw” per se) not a criticism of the player (ie camper).	NoArgument	test
video games				Elsewhere I used the example of college hoops before the shot clock.	NoArgument	test
video games				It sucked but it wasn’t the team’s fault.	NoArgument	test
video games				They had to “fix” the game by adding the shot clock.	NoArgument	test
video games				hm, Im not sure I totally agree with your idea of game design criticism (or my reading comprehension sucks today lol); I mean, if a game is geared towards assault gameplay and you camp, then you become the problem imo...	NoArgument	test
video games				If your game style is lying in wait, then you should play games styled for stealthy kills or alter your gameplay	NoArgument	test
video games				This comes back to “spirit of the game” critique.	NoArgument	test
video games				That’s how innovation (sport/war/game) often happens.	NoArgument	test
video games				Someone stops playing the “right way”.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everyone freaks out, then everyone copies them, then (if necessary) the games evolves and so on....	NoArgument	test
video games				To war, think of the American story we tell ourselves about how we fought.	NoArgument	test
video games				We broke the rules of war.	NoArgument	test
video games				Basically becoming guerrillas hiding in trees etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mentioned elsewhere that’s what folks are supposed to do..find relative advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you have more troops, we run and hide in bushes.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you have a better defensive we don’t run, we run play action and throw over the top etc...Sun Tzu’s  ideas apply to video games as well   People with power built on status quo ALWAYS complain when an innovate exploits the rules.	NoArgument	test
video games				Generally people without power have to either get more power/skill in the way they lack, or innovate within the constraints.	NoArgument	test
video games				>that’s what folks are supposed to do..find relative advantage  The thing is, video games are not actual war.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thats not what folks are supposed to do, they are supposed to clash against each other, providing each other with fun and thrill.	NoArgument	test
video games				So the game would be evolving from everyone having fun to some people having fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thats where the backlash is coming from.	NoArgument	test
video games				Having everyone becoming campers, when its not a tactical game like arma but an action oriented one like cod, means the death of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				I get what your saying, I just think the idea of evolving gameplay should be limited to games geared that way (Apex and Overwatch for example).	NoArgument	test
video games				Im gonna take this idea to an extreme probably, but consider:  If a player is hacking to have a higher dps weapon that isnt allowed in that particular map, should the game then alter so that weapon is allowed in the map?	NoArgument	test
video games				Should the hacker start a revolution or be punished for not following the proper constraints?	NoArgument	test
video games				Admittedly, that example is less a matter of gameplay choices and more an example of breaking the game but the principle is similar enough: does the game "fix" itself, or does it stay true to its design?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because there's a difference between having an advantage and playing by the "rules"; you can have the advantage by choosing to fight on the high ground vs trekking through a valley, which is a reasonable tactic.	NoArgument	test
video games				or you can forfeit rules and sit in a corner, erasing the point of the game right?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because that doesnt become a tactic, it becomes a cheat imo  I completely agree about gaining skills or innovating, which is why I say there's a difference between tactic and not following certain constraints.	NoArgument	test
video games				And maybe this discussion comes down more to morals and less about whether it's allowed or not; in all technicalities, you're allowed to eat raw meat at a vegan protest.	NoArgument	test
video games				is it rude?	NoArgument	test
video games				fek yeah; is it wrong?	NoArgument	test
video games				not necessarily	NoArgument	test
video games				The only time I would argue that camping is not OK is if you are spawn camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's just super frustrating for the person/team to feel like they aren't even part of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Other then that it seems like its just a bunch of salt coming from people who died.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't spawn camp in most FPS games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Spawns are randomized to put you as far away from the enemy as possible.	NoArgument	test
video games				I know it doens't apply to most FPS's, especially the more modern ones.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm just saying that is the only time I feel a complaint about camping is warrented.	NoArgument	test
video games				This strategy is implemented because spawn camping is not okay.	NoArgument	test
video games				What about camping a tactical insertion device instead of destroying it?	NoArgument	test
video games				Fair play?	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not sure what that is but my guess is something you must interact with to win?	NoArgument	test
video games				Then yes it’s fair.	NoArgument	test
video games				A player or team should clear the area when they get there and expect resistance at any point along the way.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's a fixed spawn point that you set yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				It helps you stay behind enemy lines in fixed base modes.	NoArgument	test
video games				In that case I would say it depends on the game but err on the side of saying it’s okay.	NoArgument	test
video games				If your tactical spawn is being tactically camped by their team then it is pretty fair.	NoArgument	test
video games				The danger of having a FOB is the higher chance that it would be attacked.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just making sure we're on the same page.	NoArgument	test
video games				Depends On the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				In  battlefield  sure the maps are huge anyway.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I have vietnam flashbacks from people going one man army noobtube and claymore  and ditting in a buikdingon mw2, and I mean it's theoretically OK but it  dry annoying and is not conducive to a fun game play experience.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it depends on the actual mechanics of the game whether camping Is annoying or not.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you highlight my point.	NoArgument	test
video games				First off “annoying” to who?!To the dude (I’m from CA. Dude refers to everyone) getting camped?	NoArgument	test
video games				The dude doing the camping?	NoArgument	test
video games				Or some aesthetic ideal vis a vis a 3rd party viewer?	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, your job is to “annoy” frustrate you opponent.(in service of defeating them).	NoArgument	test
video games				So the dude getting beat downs annoyance isn’t just irrelevant, it’s a primary goal.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly, the notion of trade offs being essential still holds true.	NoArgument	test
video games				Regardless of game design.	NoArgument	test
video games				Actually BECAUSE of game design.	NoArgument	test
video games				You look for “flaws” in design of game to exploit to defeat your opponent.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree, watching folks exploit these loopholes isn’t always fun/pretty to watch.	NoArgument	test
video games				Back to sports as an example.	NoArgument	test
video games				In college hoops teams devised a (winning) strategy of getting a lead and then playing keep away (four in a corner) and would just pass the ball around and around and hold the lead.	NoArgument	test
video games				It was horrible to watch (as a fan), the games were very low scoring, but some teams famously used it to great success.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Ie to be victorious!).	NoArgument	test
video games				The game design was changed (added the shot clock) and the great teams (or lesser out of desperation) found new ways of exploiting “gameplay”.	NoArgument	test
video games				(eg going bananas on 3pt shots).	NoArgument	test
video games				Can it be ugly to watch?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is it against the “spirit” of the game?	NoArgument	test
video games				The winners will give you one answer and the losers another.	NoArgument	test
video games				Finding and exploiting flaws in the constraints of the game arguably is the way games are advanced.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gentlemanly notions of aesthetics and fairness are typically advanced by folks with an outsized advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is just cheap, but I do it too.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not against the rules, and it can bite you in the ass sometimes   It's just not fun to play against a camper this why it enrages people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Especially in BR'S when the campers are really just hiding and you spend the entire game trying to find that last bastard only to see him die to zone and waste 5 mins of your life.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's the real sin, if your going to camp, at least coax me to push your position dont waste both of our times	NoArgument	test
video games				I'd argue that it is just as bad in Battlefield.	NoArgument	test
video games				Because of the size and openness of the map, you inevitably end up with a third to half of the team picking the sniper class and camping out in the spawn or near it, which sucks considering Battlefield is mostly objective-based gameplay.	NoArgument	test
video games				When they are sitting on that hill sniping, they aren't playing the objective.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				That is totally fine if people can avoid these tactics.	NoArgument	test
video games				It sounds like he was describing placing a remotely detonated explosive on the spawn pad which is impossible to counter.	NoArgument	test
video games				Any move with no counter is a failure in gameplay.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is 100% acceptable in FPS games.	NoArgument	test
video games				But you know where it's NOT okay?	NoArgument	test
video games				MMORPGs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping the shit out of some poor lvl 37 warrior in the Badlands for 2+ hours?	NoArgument	test
video games				Not cool, man.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's definitely a dick move.	NoArgument	test
video games				I find camping to be a challenge, and part of the game by design.	NoArgument	test
video games				I disagree with you quite a bit on the point of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let’s use Battlefield, which has since the beginning had people whining about snipers shooting into the home base, and later just about any base.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your role in that game isn’t to be a sniper to camp out for enjoying your own K/D ratio.	NoArgument	test
video games				That’s because the game itself isn’t designed around kills.	NoArgument	test
video games				The quick respawn, to infinity really, tells me the game designer also didn’t mean for you to enjoy the game by inflicting frustration on the other side — alone.	NoArgument	test
video games				Basically you’re in a team game in something like Battlefield.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your team needs you, by design, to use the sniper kit as part of the squad system to advance into other areas: not keep them.	NoArgument	test
video games				There has been countless scenarios where the sniper’s kit was necessary to fill out the rest of a squad.	NoArgument	test
video games				Since people misunderstand the role of the sniper as camper, DICE and EA since BF1942 have had to: add explosives to the sniper to incentivize movement up close; add medium range rifles to all classes; add glare to the sniper scope for others to see; weaken sniper rifles; add mortars and artillery; commander view...	NoArgument	test
video games				it was meant in a major way not to address camping concerns but to disincentive snipers from acting as distant Rambos to the detriment of the team/squad dynamic where they are actually useful.	NoArgument	test
video games				Plus, most snipers suck at distance.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your first point about balance didn’t come naturally, but because people valued K/D and “trolling” the opposition force over the point of the game, teamwork of the designed classes to reach and tackle objectives with a long range component in them.	NoArgument	test
video games				The surprise is taking the objective from the enemy to win for the team, but the mirror surprise is seeing a quarter of your team on the same mountain near the home airstrip shooting away without purpose.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now you have less people on the advance, and more people individually trying to be in the top three kills.	NoArgument	test
video games				In sport and in war we have rules that reduce your chance of winning but that most people follow because to do otherwise would violate our sense of fairness or principles.	NoArgument	test
video games				So, in basketball, you get a penalty for travelling with the ball.	NoArgument	test
video games				It would be a hell of a lot easier to just hold the ball to your chest and run around with it for any distance you require, but everyone has agreed that the game is much more interesting when you have to dribble and therefore risk having the ball stolen from you.	NoArgument	test
video games				In war it would be super convenient to just use chemical or biological weapons to destroy your enemy outside of the battlefield, but most people have agreed this method of warmaking is too indiscriminate and should therefore be a war crime.	NoArgument	test
video games				So the "realism" argument fails, since in real life people generally agree to certain things in games and even war that might still put you at a disadvantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				Last but not least, there is no outwitting happening with camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				In video games you have control over your player's position at all times except when respawning, in which case your position has been predetermined for you.	NoArgument	test
video games				Imagine if you were being hunted by an assassin and you could do anything you wanted all day, but every single night at 8pm you HAD to step off your back porch, turn on the light, and stand there for several seconds without moving because you temporarily lost control of your body.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you "outwitted" by your assassin when he murders you?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's very game dependent.	NoArgument	test
video games				Deathmatch?	NoArgument	test
video games				Go ahead and camp.	NoArgument	test
video games				Team or squad based game?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah I'm gonna call you out for prioritizing k/d ratio instead PTFO.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lastly, yeah some people camp for the lolz.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is kind of unique to online video games where you are anonymous and there are no consequences.	NoArgument	test
video games				Trolling in a live sport/competition is considered unsportsmanlike and has consequences.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if there are no in-game consequences, you will still suffer a hit to your reputation and probably noone will want to play with you.	NoArgument	test
video games				For this reason I think camping could be considered similarly unsportsmanlike if it's done for those reasons rather than actual gameplay reasons.	NoArgument	test
video games				It comes down to fun vs trying to win.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping, even if it is ultimately the best strategy in a game, comes down to waiting around and hoping the other side shows themselves to get a kill.	NoArgument	test
video games				If everyone did that, no one could.	NoArgument	test
video games				So the camper gets to have the fun while the others don't.	NoArgument	test
video games				A lot of people realize they could get kills without much risk if they camp and wait - but that it is more fun for everyone involved if they don't.	NoArgument	test
video games				Games are ultimately about having fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even pro esports players, when not playing official matches, play sub-optimally when playing casual matches in order to have more fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would say the argument used to be valid but is no longer.	NoArgument	test
video games				Older games often had rushed multiplayer modes like goldeneye.	NoArgument	test
video games				reusing existing maps with minor mods to work for multiplayer.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t think the developers expected it would get as popular as it did or be exploited like it was.	NoArgument	test
video games				So when they dropped spawn points they didn’t worry much about spawn camping, or having an especially balanced map without camp spots.	NoArgument	test
video games				And when it became an issue, it was already published and the maps couldn’t be fixed.	NoArgument	test
video games				So to preserve the enjoyment of the game, many people added the home rule of no camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's usually fine, but I'd argue camping when the mechanics expect be aggressive in order to capitalise on impatient opponents is poor sportsmanship.	NoArgument	test
video games				(I.e. camping outside on siege so the defenders are forced to wait out the clock or lose)	NoArgument	test
video games				I get irritated when someone on my team camps & doesn't contribute.	NoArgument	test
video games				obviously certain game modes requiring camping to win like flag based games but I hate in TDM having some kid with a shotgun sit somewhere waiting for the surprise kills and he doesn't help win.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Why in goodness name “should” you run out to meet your opponent on a “fair” battleground?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because it’s a **game** and the entire point is to have fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				Complains against camping date back to earlier FFA games where map and weapon balance was still being worked out.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, in Quake the Rocket Launcher was wildly more powerful than any other weapon, was usually limited to 1 per map, and always dropped in the same place on a fixed timer.	NoArgument	test
video games				Death match games were often just get the rocket launcher, cycle around to pick up a few items, and then grab the rocket launcher again when it spawned.	NoArgument	test
video games				It was extremely difficult to drop the guy holding it and it turned almost every map into an irritating game of king of the hill.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'd agree with you that modern games don't have this problem as much, but I will address another point.	NoArgument	test
video games				You continually make references to physical sports like football to justify annoying strategies in video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Physical sports change their rules all the time in response to annoying strategies.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, hockey was nearly killed because the neutral zone trap turned every game into a slog.	NoArgument	test
video games				They changed the rules to open up the passing game.	NoArgument	test
video games				In football, they tightened up the rules around illegal contact to improve the passing game.	NoArgument	test
video games				In soccer, they created the pass back rule to keep a team in the lead from just kicking the ball to their own goalie so he could pick it up and drop kick it away.	NoArgument	test
video games				All of those could be justified as playing to win, but they were awful to watch and participate in.	NoArgument	test
video games				The reason that camping is considered unhealthy to a gameplay environment in most incarnations of FPS is that it severely limits player interaction.	NoArgument	test
video games				Basically, if all, or even most, of the players find a place to camp for excessively long periods of time, no one will ever find each other.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are other versions of this tactic, i.e.	NoArgument	test
video games				turtling in an RTS.	NoArgument	test
video games				If no one leaves their hiding spot, there is no one to become entrapped or caught and the game ends in a tie.	NoArgument	test
video games				Consider the prospect of "noob tubing" as well.	NoArgument	test
video games				Firing grenades into the opposing teams spawn is a good tactic, but when that tactic is too overpowered and popular, it forces the meta to change in a way the stifles other ideas and makes the game feel too randomized and chaotic.	NoArgument	test
video games				For a sports analogy, this would be like continuously running circles in a football field without care to yards gained or lost simply to run the timer out when you are in the lead.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Which is why most sports have a limit on stalling tactics like a shot clock or not allowing you to needlessly cross to the other side of the court.)	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is frowned upon because it requires little skill.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, you are ensuring an easier victory by camping around normal routes in games in get kills.	NoArgument	test
video games				But you are being perceived as a poor player that shows little desire to challenge him/herself by actively *not* moving about a map and engaging with enemy players head on.	NoArgument	test
video games				I haven't heard the term camping in forever and I thought you meant actually outdoor camping in a video game and now I want a camping game where people attack you at night like The Forest	NoArgument	test
video games				You can use whatever strategy you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				But other people dont have to enjoy playing with people who use said strategy.	NoArgument	test
video games				And in the end its a game people play for fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its like using oddjob in goldeneye.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes its a provided strategy of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				But your friends are allowed to complain that the games not fun to play with you.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it entirely depends on the game due to mainly two things: 1.	NoArgument	test
video games				What are the goals of the game type?	NoArgument	test

video games				Does the camper have too much of an advantage?.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'll compare Red Orchestra 2 and CoD to make my points.	NoArgument	test
video games				If I'm playing Red Orchestra 2, I expect people to be camping in buildings, because that is a shooter largely based on occupying strategic locations in order to defend/attack areas of the map.	NoArgument	test
video games				The goal of that game isn't to have the best K/D, and it's highly focused on team play which allows players to take turns clearing buildings with grenades.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now if I'm playing one of the old CoDs (I can't speak for new ones as I haven't played), the goal is often strictly to have a good K/D.	NoArgument	test
video games				By camping, players get a large advantage over non-campers because of reasons explained below, and if they both camp, well then nobody is actually playing the game, so it becomes a game of chicken.	NoArgument	test
video games				"Put yourself at a disadvantage, or enjoy a quiet round of nothing.".	NoArgument	test
video games				These games often feature weapons that do considerably better in close range (where-as with Ro2, a shotgun and a rifle could both be 1-hit kills at that range) and essentially allow the play to specialize in camping over another player who is outfitted to play in medium range on the rest of the map.	NoArgument	test
video games				>gameplay balances almost everything out.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are trade offs for most elements of games.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you pick a long range weapon you’re not going to have rapid fire.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you pick a strong character you might move more slowly.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah but people don't.	NoArgument	test
video games				Things that work on lower tiers doesn't work in the upper tiers where they learn how to combat it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Until then the gameplay loop (instead of figuring out shooting and movement and map, positioning and other gameplay features), it is to wait until something, somewhere randomly kills you.	NoArgument	test
video games				And it will keep killing you until you understand the relevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				An information you cannot learn, if you are unable to properly play the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				On higher levels, it's simply the flashback of frustration you felt when starting playing that game.	NoArgument	test
video games				And since people are unable to ancknowledge their mistakes, they blame the universally hated campers.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is therefore considered a bad form.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like tee bagging, or writing "?" in the chat.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's done to piss people off.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's why snipers in simulator shooters are acceptable and not called campers.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I think that camping in (shooter) games is perfectly OK. For some reason it’s considered to be an unholy sin to lay in wait for another player.  Camping, I would argue, is a low skill endeavor that will almost never result in personal improvement, or victory.  > 1) gameplay balances almost everything out. Likewise there is a cost/benefit with camping. Perhaps you get fewer absolute kills but a better K/D ratio, which brings me to the next point  I'd say the tradeoff for camping is generally losing. And trying to play around an opponent who is playing to lose is frustrating.  A padded K/D ratio is hardly impressive if you can never win the match.  > 2) Different games have different tactics. Camping may be appropriate for certain games/certain conditions.  Playing defense is not the same as camping. In a Capture and Hold type situation, the camper would be the guy hiding far away from any objective, looking for cheap kills.  And, speaking as a current PUBG player, a game where camping is certainly considered a viable tactic...it's still generally a loser's gambit.  > 3) which relates to a larger point....your job is to frustrate/surprise your opponent.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why in goodness name “should” you run out to meet your opponent on a “fair” battleground?	NoArgument	test
video games				If they want/expect a battle in open field, you fight them in the trees, if they want to battle on horseback, you run them into a marsh, and so on.	NoArgument	test
video games				“Come fight me where I expect in the way I expect” doesn’t hold much weight with me.	NoArgument	test
video games				Disagree.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think every player's job should be to win, and the majority of time, in my experience (and arguably most others) is that camping simply does not win you the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				And if you're play style consistently loses you the game, and encourages poor skill development, and at best, results in mildly frustrating the rest of the players...yeah, you're gonna catch some hate thrown your way.	NoArgument	test
video games				Playing a physical objective isn't camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sniping isnt camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				Laying an ambush isnt camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				Camping is generally when someone is using those tactics on a non essential area to pad their kd.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's when they aren't playing the game the rest of the lobby is, they're playing "how many kills can I get regardless of winning or losing".	NoArgument	test
video games				I think camping is always okay as long as it isn't in a game breaking spot.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you are getting spawn killed repeatedly by some guy just sitting in a sweet spot then that just ruins the fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				But as long as the spot is fair, if someone is camping, you need to think a little to beat them at their own game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Take the long way around and ambush them or something.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is satisfaction in finally killing someone who has been killing you from the same vantage point over and over again.	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe that the reason it is seen as an "unholy sin" as you put it, is because it is the equivalent of kicking someone when they are down.	NoArgument	test
video games				As the player is presumably re-spawning, that means they just died; so it's sorta like kicking someone when they are down.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, in an all out, fight for your life, damn fucking right, I'm kicking my opponent when they are down; I'm also punching em in the nuts and trying to gouge their eyes out.	NoArgument	test
video games				But those are not particularly gentlemanly ways of fighting.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you think that any competitive game should have rules above and beyond the mere limitations of the game itself, on the conduct of players?	NoArgument	test
video games				Like, in chess, the game of chess does not itself say you cannot insult your opponent during the game; and in clubhouse play, people do that.	NoArgument	test
video games				But in a tournament?	NoArgument	test
video games				You'll get your ass disqualified so quickly for doing that.....	NoArgument	test
video games				So it's a bit of an etiquitte thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Since the game is played for fun, a player who *just died* and is re-spawning is *waiting* to play the game (for fun) dying INSTANTLY upon re-spawn means the player has 0 fun, and has 0 opportunity for fun (some players don't have fun, but they had the opportunity to have fun!)  So I mean, how do you feel about kicking people when they are down, or throwing sand in their faces, in a hypothetical [non-life or death] fight?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think camping is fine in video games as long as it is contributing to the objective.	NoArgument	test
video games				As you pointed out, if you are winning an objective and have to hold that position, camping is perfectly valuable.	NoArgument	test
video games				However camping being good is really just a conditional situation for whatever objective.	NoArgument	test
video games				If I am on a team playing capture the flag and the other team is heavily camping their flag, I will eventually win that game through attrition but the camping guarantees that they won't win as they won't make a move to the main objective, capturing my flag.	NoArgument	test
video games				Them basically ignoring my flag turns the objective of the game from what should be a back and forth into a fps tower defense essentially.	NoArgument	test
video games				This also hurts people who do not want to camp but have teammates who are heavily involved in camping.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they try to move forward they will be consistently outnumbered.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if they do find a way to sneak into enemy lines and capture the flag, their allies who are camping are likely not in prime position to react and assist in bringing the stolen flag back to base.	NoArgument	test
video games				All their allies are essentially doing is delaying their inevitable defeat.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why are you mad at me I just want to click on some heads while my hot pockets are cooking	NoArgument	test
video games				It depends.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is it like spawncamping in Overwatch or something similar, where a person repeatedly kills people by their spawnpoint who are too inept to kill the camper?	NoArgument	test
video games				(I speak as someone who has been in the side of ineptitude.) Or is it someone who hides in a multiplayer fighting game like Smash Bros., never taking part in the action, just waiting so as to preserve lives?	NoArgument	test
video games				First, I'm not much of a FPS gamer so my opinion comes more from the point of view of a MMORPG player, though I of course played fps too.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm assuming that by camping you mean someone hiding in a random spot of the map, well hidden, and killing whoever go past him, and not referring to player defending their bases or anything else that might require people to stay in the same position.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your opinion of camping is ok is kinda problematic to me.	NoArgument	test
video games				Basically, it seems like the reason you play the game is to frustrate other players and win at all costs.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the original purpose of a game is to have fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				At the end of the day, do you play to have a higher K/D ratio or do you play to have fun?	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course most player will try to player better and have better results, but that's secondary.	NoArgument	test
video games				They won't start treating the game as a job or a chore.	NoArgument	test
video games				Fun first, result second.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here is the problem though.	NoArgument	test
video games				What happens when everyone try to maximize K/D ratio and do camping?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well...Nothing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Since everyone camps, nothing happens.	NoArgument	test
video games				My point is that a lot of those "smart" strategy like camping rely on the other players playing for fun and not to win at all costs.	NoArgument	test
video games				So in this case camping ruins people fun because you feel like winning at all cost and frustrating others.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course they will be angry with you!	NoArgument	test
video games				The only reasonable solution I can think of is have different game modes : one which allows for "dirty" strategy like camping and one which forbide them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Until that happens I think there will always be people who feel justified to do camping and people who feel justified to curse those people.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mostly agree with you that it isn't wrong to camp in games, especially when you are playing a game mode where you should defend a point or something, then the objective of the game is to camp and there is nothing wrong with it.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I do think that there are a few instances where you shouldn't camp even if it is giving you a tactical advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				A little while ago I played an fps game with a friend, we played on a private server on a map that was made for about 8 people, but we were only 2, it would have given me a tactical advantage to camp but I didn't because it took a long time anyways to find each other on this big map, if I was camping it would take even more time.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, if we both camped because we both found that to be the best strategy, we would just be sitting at opposite points of the map, waiting for the other player to make a move.	NoArgument	test
video games				So I would argue that sometimes the most important part of the game is not to win, but to have fun, and if camping makes the game less fun for you or the other players you are playing with, maybe you shouldn't camp.	NoArgument	test
video games				I doubt it, because if you're even able to camp in a video-game, it means that either your team is far better than the other, which means the matchmaking is broken and you're ruining the whole other team enjoyment of the game since they can't do anything, or it means that you're using a glitch/broken feature to achieve that, making you no better than a literal cheater.

video games				If one of your big disappointments is the lack of character development, I think you should look at Rapture itself as a character.	NoArgument	test
video games				As you go through the game, you learn more and more about what kind of place it was and what led to its eventual dystopian downfall.	NoArgument	test
video games				The issue of a lack of character development is that there isn't much to build upon.	NoArgument	test

video games				I can understand why there would be a lack of characters to create an atmosphere, but if that was what they were going for, they should've made it clearer, but it just seemed to me like the lack of characters was due to laziness/wanting to cut corners.	NoArgument	test
video games				When exactly did you first experience this game?	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you keeping central in your mind the fact that this game came out 12 years ago?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, and I was aware that it felt a little dated, but I was willing to look past that due to how much hype surrounded the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well the amount of hype surrounding a game like Doom is infinitely greater.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even Doom is completely irredeemable from the perspective of a modern gamer.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Even Doom is completely irredeemable from the perspective of a modern gamer.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'd actually disagree.	NoArgument	test
video games				Doom is still visceral fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				It has aged far better than many other considerably newer shooters - try going back to play many of the significantly newer 3D-based FPS games on the original Playstation for instance.	NoArgument	test
video games				They're slow, clunky, and awkward in comparison, and have really boring and bland level designs in comparison..	NoArgument	test
video games				Your point being?	NoArgument	test
video games				Bioshock was acclaimed for its aesthetic/setting, audiovisual quality, and gameplay, and it’s not right to attack it for its story, which is widely acknowledged as its worst element, especially what you address!	NoArgument	test
video games				If you want to make a character study, study Rapture, an extremely iconic video game location.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ve never heard of anyone else having issues with the Big Daddies, just shoot at them!	NoArgument	test
video games				>There is A LOT of backtracking in BioShock,  Really?	NoArgument	test
video games				I can’t remember any after 3-5 playthroughs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Bioshock is like the inverse of Infinite, where the storytelling was so much better than the gameplay.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've never heard anyone say that the worst element of BioShock is its story.	NoArgument	test
video games				What reviews were you looking at?	NoArgument	test
video games				You sure?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because all I can remember is walking in out of the same four or five rooms and hallways fetching things and shooting enemies until I progressed to another level, where the cycle repeated itself ad nauseam for fifty hours.	NoArgument	test
video games				**Hey OP, are you familiar with Ayn Rand and Objectivism?** Because the game is pretty much explicitly a commentary on that philosophy, the whole Rapture is based on Objectivism, Andrew Ryan is directly based on Rand (ANDREW RYAN = WE R AYN RAND), and all the speeches, moral choices, and problems are basically lifted wholsale from Rand's books, which the authors admit.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, allow me to answer your criticisms *through the lens of Objectivism*, with which the game should be judged:     \- **Splicers, Daddies, and Little sisters have almost no personality** \- this is on purpose, they are supposed to be "moochers and looters" as per the game's philosophy; degenerate creatures created by fall of Rapture's ideals     \- **Big Daddies too hard** \- again, this is on purpose.	NoArgument	test
video games				As Rand/Ryan would say, life is what it is, it is your fault that you are not good enough of a player, not that Daddies are too hard.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is a fight for survival, nobody said it would be easy     \-  **story feels really contrived and convoluted at times.** \- the overly complex problem are caused by the fall of Rapture's philosophy: it used to be a technological and capitalist utopia, in which everything was straightforward and reasonable, it was the meddling ofthe moochers and looters that fucked it up.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you feel frustration solving these quests, congratulations!	NoArgument	test
video games				You now understand what it feels to live in a world ruined by collectivism and irrationality.	NoArgument	test
video games				\- **characters do not feel real**; because they had stripped themselves of their "realness" by their own bad choices.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is telling that the only real human interaction you get is with Ryan, because it is his final cry of defiance.	NoArgument	test
video games				\- **Fontaine a  moustache twirling villain** : this is because Fontaine betrayed the Objectivist values Ryan based Rapture on.	NoArgument	test
video games				He is a Looter type villain and thus, in the end, when his only weapon of criminal cleverness is stripped, he has not much more to say than insults, and not much in actual combat valour and prowess.	NoArgument	test
video games				He is all talk and little integrity in the end.	NoArgument	test
video games				\- **You become Big Daddy, but then become normal again**: you assume the "role" of a guardian of a fallen looter system , but strip it before the final confrontation to fight the ultimate evil with your own hard earned merits.	NoArgument	test
video games				\-  **The moral choice for this game comes from the save/kill little sisters,  but this fails because all of the little sisters feel void of character;** they are like that on purpose, you are not supposed to save them because you like them, but because IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.	NoArgument	test
video games				*Using kids as enslaved tools is objectively evil,* it is against basic moral values of liberty and non-violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no moral justification in hurting a child even once, or profiting from it's slavery.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no black and white here: killing kids is always wrong.	NoArgument	test
video games				Considering child murder or abuse a "gray area" is typical collectivist mentality, using people as means to an end.	NoArgument	test
video games				**THe ironic/awesome thing** about this game is that Rapture was based on Objectivism, but ultimately failed due to human flaws, but if YOU, the player make all the choices in the game according to the basic rules of Objectivism, you not only get the good ending, but the game is really easy.	NoArgument	test
video games				The game constantly punishes you for being lazy, not rational, acting immoral, not paying attention, etc, while it also rewards you for hard work, focus, rational actions, good resources and money management, and moral actions.	NoArgument	test

video games				They picked an obscure philosophy and dug deep into its lore, so I find it hard to believe the similarities are a coincidence.	NoArgument	test

video games				Okay, so I think I can give a somewhat nuanced answer here.	NoArgument	test
video games				First of all, as a disclaimer, the meta-analysis shows that [the link between video games and violence is minimal at best.](http://christopherjferguson.com/Angry%20Birds.pdf) Violent crime has gone down as the sale of video games has gone up, and video games exist around the world, but the problems of violence are focused in particular areas.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is clearly not the driving factor.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even talking about video games as linked to violence is just a distraction from real causes like poverty, substance abuse, child abuse, and radicalization, which is precisely why so many politicians bring it up.	NoArgument	test
video games				That all being said, there are three things worth examining video games over: (1) the lessons the games teach, (2) the culture around gaming, and (3) video games as propaganda for violent groups.	NoArgument	test
video games				So on the first point, the message of video games are clearly not a monolith.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like movies, there is a lot of variety.	NoArgument	test
video games				Grand Theft Auto will be different from Undertale, will be different from Angry Birds, will be different from Tetris.	NoArgument	test
video games				But there are still tropes worth looking at in games as well, namely trying to get rid of sexist or racist stereotypes that can show up from time to time.	NoArgument	test
video games				Beating up a hooker in Grand Theft Auto might not lead to you beating one up in real life, but if that is *all* you see, you should take care that the media you consume doesn't leave you with a warped picture of the world.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is where things like feminist critiques of video games for how they portray women can become useful, the work of Anita Sarkeesian coming to mind.	NoArgument	test
video games				Which also brings me to the second point, of video games as a propaganda tool.	NoArgument	test
video games				The events surrounding "Gamergate" shows how the culture around gaming can be poisoned and turned into harassment campaigns.	NoArgument	test
video games				Relatively minor or entirely baseless incidents are blown *far* out of proportion, and the relative anonymity of video games, and really the internet in general, allows people to do crazy things like send people death threats with relative certainty they won't see any consequences for their actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				This can really be analyzed as part of internet culture and cyber bullying in general, and video games will play a part of that.	NoArgument	test
video games				And finally, there is the use of video games as propaganda.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games are popular, so a lot of hate groups will use, or lets be honest, manufacture controversies like Gamergate to try and radicalize people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nazis on 4chan will try and take an incident like that to get people to start speaking their language, to train them to attack the people they don't like, and normalize that hatred.	NoArgument	test
video games				Glamorizing shooting and killing is also a troubling aspect in itself, which is also why video games should be analyzed as [propaganda tools funded by the US military.](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/army-video-games/)  Playing video games will not make you a killer, and banning video games won't do any good.	NoArgument	test
video games				But seriously analyzing the culture and message of video games is still really important.	NoArgument	test
video games				> manufacture controversies like Gamergate  How in the name of \*\*\*\* is Gamergate a manufactured controversy?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well, in ****'s name, it was basically just a paper-thin excuse made up by 4chan and 8chan to excuse sending death and rape threats to women in video game media.	NoArgument	test
video games				[Read up.](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/new-chat-logs-show-how-4chan-users-pushed-gamergate-into-the-national-spotlight/)	NoArgument	test
video games				Considering that I can't even open up the links to the Logs that supposedly prove anything and that the article accepts who is a "Sleeper Cell" based on information provided by Zoe Quinn, who, you must admit, had a stake in the entire thing, I think I am going to dismiss this criticism.	NoArgument	test
video games				They even admit:  >For those focused on the kernel of actual valid issues of game journalism ethics somehow churned up during this whole mess  So yeah.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not even going to pretend that the #GamerGate site covered itself in Glory, or that there were people participating on the side of the "movement" who did fucked up things, but I don't think all of it is fabricated.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe motivated actors managed to make it into a bigger thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe the catalyst that caused all of it is questionable.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that doesn't mean that there weren't (and aren't) some ethical concerns about the state of video game journalism.	NoArgument	test
video games				And, in consequence, that doesn't mean it was a fabricated controversy.	NoArgument	test
video games				Motivated actors planning to make something out of basically nothing for ulterior motives is the definition of a manufactured controversy.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are some ethical concerns in gaming journalism, but none really addressed by the core of the Gamergate movement.	NoArgument	test
video games				Bigger concerns would just be the advertising relation between the big gaming companies and journalists more generally, and the measures they take to manipulate the reviewers and turn their sites into basically misleading advertisement platforms.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not secret feminist conspiracies to make more story-driven games.	NoArgument	test

NoArgument	test
video games				>Even talking about video games as linked to violence is just a distraction from real causes like poverty, substance abuse, child abuse, and radicalization, which is precisely why so many politicians bring it up.	NoArgument	test
video games				As I have mentioned earlier, gun rights supporters bring up Switzerland as a country awash with military-grade firearms, but without a mass shooting problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I doubt that Switzerland is free of poverty, substance abuse, child abuse, and radicalization (it has lower poverty rates than the USA, though) - plus, they also have video games, movies, books and TV there too.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Okay, but if people are getting bad lessons from video games like GTA, and the military sponsors video games to brainwash people into supporting them, how come "the link between video games and violence is minimal at best"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because those are different questions.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some games having a racist or a sexist message that needs to be critically analyzed, and some games being used to glamorize military service, is very different from questions of whether playing video games will make you go out and commit violent crimes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games don't teach you habits to start killing people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Driving over people in GTA won't teach you to drive over people in real life, and that's the question most people are interested in when politicians talk about banning video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				But propaganda always has been and continues to be an effective recruitment tool.	NoArgument	test
video games				And that is true of all mediums, including video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				So there is a real burden that we should be careful for what we consume.	NoArgument	test
video games				>This is where things like feminist critiques of video games for how they portray women can become useful, the work of Anita Sarkeesian coming to mind.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah but all that 'work' is based upon utter bullshit that is not-even-wrong.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the link between video games and gun violence is minuscule, the link between it and violence against women is likely non-existent or negatively correlated.	NoArgument	test
video games				> The events surrounding "Gamergate" shows how the culture around gaming can be poisoned and turned into harassment campaigns.	NoArgument	test
video games				If that is the bar for 'propaganda tool' then you'd better add breast feeding to that list.	NoArgument	test

video games				> Video games are popular, so a lot of hate groups will use, or lets be honest, manufacture controversies like Gamergate to try and radicalize people.	NoArgument	test
video games				First off, this is true of ANY media.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly, video games have a profit motive and are incredibly hard to make compared to other media.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is barking up the wrong tree.	NoArgument	test
video games				Youtube videos are 100000X more pernicious, accessible, and cheap to produce.	NoArgument	test
video games				Basically, all of the arguments that you lay out are true of MANY things and far more causally related to those things than to video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				You could replace 'video games' with almost any media in your key arguments and your arguments would be more true.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree that any media needs to be looked at this way.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's my point, dude.	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games, like other media, deserves to be critically analyzed.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I agree that any media needs to be looked at this way  Where we seem to differ is that I believe that all of your examples apply *less* to video games than most other media.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not sure how to phrase this, so I'll come right out: you are posing and black or white/ either-or question. You might re phrase it to just ask what folks think in general, or if they agree with the specific points you presented. As it is, you have set it up as either you believe "a" or you believe "b". This, like everything in life, is most likely a spectrum. So.... Are you wanting to know A) if people think video games are to blame? B) people believe in either of the other arguments you present, or C) what does reddit think is causing mass shootings?	NoArgument	test
video games				Btw, not beating up your question, just asking you to clarify and not think of it as either-or.	NoArgument	test
video games				> So.... Are you wanting to know A) if people think video games are to blame? B) people believe in either of the other arguments you present, or C) what does reddit think is causing mass shootings?	NoArgument	test
video games				I want A.	NoArgument	test
video games				Please CMV my opinion that video games are not to blame for most mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mean, I often encounter articles claiming "research shows that video games are not to blame for mass shootings", but is there a good reason for me to dismiss and disbelieve that research?	NoArgument	test
video games				Video games aren't to blame for ANY mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				EVEN if a hypothetical shooter attributed all of their motivation to his love of gaming, it would still be THE SHOOTER who is to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's very unlikely that any ONE thing cause mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				From all the things that might cause them, I'm seriously doubtful that videogames would be more impactful than, say, movies.	NoArgument	test
video games				> From all the things that might cause them, I'm seriously doubtful that videogames would be more impactful than, say, movies.	NoArgument	test
video games				But movies (and TV, and books, and board games) are not uniquely American either.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why should they be blamed for mass shootings alongside video games?	NoArgument	test
video games				It could be desensitization to and glorification of violence +  some sort of radicalization and feelings of alienation + ???	NoArgument	test
video games				+ access to firearms that all play a role in violence, especially seemingly random acts of mass violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				People shouldn't be saying that it is all or even primarily or even significantly caused by video games or just violence in the media in general, but it could play some role or be some sort of influencing factor in these acts of violence.	NoArgument	test
video games				Any role it plays, if indeed it does play a role, is certainly far less than radicalization and access to firearms.	NoArgument	test
video games				If video games were the problem, south korea would be a hotbed for mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem is access to firearms, American obsession with guns, the 2nd amendment.	NoArgument	test
video games				> The problem is access to firearms, American obsession with guns, the 2nd amendment.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the pro-2nd Amendment crowd often bring up how Switzerland is awash with military-grade guns and doesn't have a mass shooting problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				Obviously, Switzerland has video games too (plus movies, TV and books), so what is their secret to having liberal gun laws and minimal mass shootings?	NoArgument	test
video games				Probably because they don’t have more guns than people.	NoArgument	test
video games				In the last 2 decades we have seen an extreme rise in popularity of military style firearms, from K98s and Enfields to M4 and M16 variant clones.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because people are now disproportionately seeing these weapons in the media they consume and they want them due to that.	NoArgument	test
video games				One key example of this is with Battlefield 1.	NoArgument	test
video games				When it was released, WWI era firearms skyrocketed in price due to a sudden onset of demand for these guns by the players of this game.	NoArgument	test
video games				By the logic that these weapons cause violence, video games cause violence, because they end up causing the large scale importation, manufacture, and distribution of these firearms  If you want more evidence, just look at how many people go out of their way on r/guns to specifically make guns from videogames, such as [Fallout](https://imgur.com/gallery/GCmz8Dz), [Metal Gear Solid](https://imgur.com/a/jQxbi),  [Borderlands](https://i.redd.it/3ktl82gs82p21.jpg) and more	NoArgument	test
video games				Well if we go down this path we can also say wealth/money causes violence, because having money allows more people to buy more weapons...	NoArgument	test
video games				That would also be an explanation, because the US is the richest nation on the planet with any real population.	NoArgument	test
video games				Per capita?	NoArgument	test
video games				Hardly.	NoArgument	test
video games				But then there are other nations where people have more wealth and money but their money doesn't cause violence...	NoArgument	test
video games				> Per capita?	NoArgument	test
video games				Hardly.	NoArgument	test
video games				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita  The only nation that rivals us is Switzerland in that regard, and they have a population of less than 10 million people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everyone else is significantly behind us	NoArgument	test
video games				pt taken  In this case in order to reduce gun violence we need to reduce the amount of money  the people have, it's clearly the most effective way!	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell, I built a [Stormtrooper AR15 pistol.](https://i.imgur.com/jZzi4q1.jpg)	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah, while I dont believe that videogames cause gun violence, videogames certainly cause guns.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do other countries *not* have access to those video games?	NoArgument	test
video games				Other countries have mass shootings - often a hell of a lot more of them  https://fee.org/articles/the-myth-that-the-us-leads-the-world-in-mass-shootings/	NoArgument	test
video games				Honestly, the "Per Million" stat is deceiving.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not surprising that countries with smaller populations are high on the list.	NoArgument	test
video games				The ratio of killed : total population is just higher when talking about mass shooting because shooters don't kill a number of people proportional to the population each time.	NoArgument	test
video games				Norway has a population of roughly 5.2 million.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's somewhere between New York City and L.A.	NoArgument	test
video games				Pennsylvania has a population of 12,807,060.	NoArgument	test
video games				The latest shooting there killed 6 people = .046 deaths per 100k   El Paso has a population of 683,577.	NoArgument	test
video games				The latest shooting there killed 46 = 6.73 deaths per 100k  Obviously El Paso is going to look more dangerous than Pennsylvania because in a single incident, more people were killed, especially in relation to the population count.	NoArgument	test
video games				So how do you accurately compare incidents that vary so wildly?	NoArgument	test
video games				The US is 65x the size of Norway.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think we'd all agree that if there were 65x the amount of mass shootings in the US, there's a problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's a problem of scale.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you also have to factor in level of "developed".	NoArgument	test
video games				Something like mass shootings per GDP per capita.	NoArgument	test
video games				Comparing the US who not only has a huge population, but vastly outproduced somewhere like Albania just doesn't make sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				Switzerland and Norway are closer to the US, but the US is still +40x more populated.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't have an answer, but the information you linked was nonetheless interesting.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it takes a truly massive nation to get statistically significant results here, you cant make any comparisons with the US to other first world countries in regards to mass shootings, as the results are simply not of large enough sample size to have statistical significance.	NoArgument	test
video games				Which I absolutely am inclined to believe  It is interesting, but unfortunately there isnt enough data to look at here for proper examples.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or I guess fortunately, as statistical significance would be requiring orders of magnitudes  more deaths	NoArgument	test
video games				The article he links is statistically bullshit.	NoArgument	test
video games				The article links to this blog [here](https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/) for the stats on "mass shooting rates world wide".	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem here is that John Lott (who very nicely publicly published his data) [used different definitions for mass shootings.	NoArgument	test
video games				The one he used for the US was much stricter and excluded terror attacks and shootings by groups of people while the definition he used for the rest of the world.](https://econjwatch.org/File+download/1105/LankfordMar2019.pdf?mimetype=pdf) When ajust for this and use a consistent definition it turns out the US leads the way regardless	NoArgument	test

video games				The reason for why killing children isn't in most games is because the ESRB will almost certainly give games an AO rating for showing a player character killing children (this is why, in Bioshock, harvesting the Little Sisters is done with a fade to black), and AO games are basically unsellable because physical retailers have a blanket policy against it.	NoArgument	test
video games				That isn't a fan theory or something developers would respond to, it's just like...	NoArgument	test
video games				a fact of the industry.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyway, violent games that push the edge of good taste can still attract negative media attention; see the game Hatred for an example of a game intentionally leaning into this.	NoArgument	test
video games				What little there is to be gained from allowing players the freedom to kill children would almost certainly be lost because, well, you made the game that's most notable for being the game that lets you kill children.	NoArgument	test
video games				The Sims example just seems bizarre to me; it seems extremely obvious that people react more viscerally to violent murder than simulationist neglect; you may as well argue that being able to call down a tornado in Cities: Skylines means it should get a higher rating than performing glory kills in Doom, since the former kills way more people.

video games				I mean, I might seek them out if I'm debating buying the product, but I certainly don't think some group should just have what amounts to a 'ban' button because they find a piece of media not to their liking.	NoArgument	test
video games				An extremely brief history of the ESRB:  * Video games get controversial due to violent, bloody or otherwise mature content (e.g. Custer's Revenge, a game in which your goal is to rape Native Americans).	NoArgument	test
video games				* Concerned groups and the government begin sabre rattling about placing legal restrictions on video game sales to adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				* The ESRB is formed to self-regulate the industry as a method of defusing potential regulation.	NoArgument	test
video games				The ESRB only has a "ban" button because the games industry itself (more or less) agrees to it.	NoArgument	test
video games				They find that there is economic value to avoiding controversy and having a legitimate authority putting out guidelines on what sort of games are acceptable for certain age groups, and that these policies serve to help the game industry as a whole by avoiding controversy for e.g.	NoArgument	test
video games				selling Doom to a 7 year old or selling pornographic games at all at major "family" retailers.	NoArgument	test
video games				TL;DR: The ESRB is itself a (convoluted) way to ensure more game sales and the economic health of the industry by avoiding controversy and regulation.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, you can argue that you personally are fine with whatever content; that's fair.	NoArgument	test
video games				But you can no expect developers to ignore the ESRB self-regulation than you can say expect them to produce your personal pet game; those decisions are going to be made on economic lines (though as I mentioned, the occasional game will court controversy sales specifically by going over the line; these games are almost universally not good).	NoArgument	test
video games				I am aware of the ESRB's history, but to me it seems like they only formed it because they were under threat.	NoArgument	test
video games				My argument is that threat should never be present in the first place.	NoArgument	test
video games				But it did, so the ESRB exists, and the long and short of it is that led to a situation where the only reason to put the ability to kill kids in your game is to get marketing as "the kid killing game."  You have to evaluate what game developers decide to do based on the reality of how people would react, not based on how you think they "should" react.	NoArgument	test

video games				This doesn't really answers the question.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why ESRB and media has a problem with killable children?	NoArgument	test
video games				And why it should stay this way?	NoArgument	test
video games				The ESRB has a problem with killing children for the same reason people find killing or harming children more significant than killing or harming adults in real life.	NoArgument	test
video games				Children have a presumption of innocence and of not being fully responsible for their actions, so letting a player kill them is worse than letting them kill (theoretically) cognizant adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				This sort of question is always weird to me, because it implies you don't already know that pretty obvious societal norm, or that if I can't adequately explain why society views committing crimes against children as worse than committing crimes against adults it somehow stops being true.	NoArgument	test
video games				As far as why it should stay that way, the biggest reason is because whatever gameplay relevance killing children on screen has would be instantly overshadowed by your game becoming "the kid-killing game" in marketing.	NoArgument	test
video games				As an actual gameplay feature, it's pretty trivial; it's an NPC but smaller.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the fact that feature is basically nonexistent means that putting it in is a very obviously intentional act and the act itself will draw a lot of attention.	NoArgument	test
video games				So you're either putting it in trivially and drawing a ton of attention to it, or somehow making killing children thematically relevant and drawing an *absurd* amount of attention to it, neither of which is likely to be worth it for any games not seeking to generate controversy.	NoArgument	test
video games				E: Obviously, the "no killing kids" thing can also look really silly when you put child NPCs who act like regular NPCs in the game (see Fallout 3), but that's more of an argument to not put characters like that in the game because they break the sense of verisimilitude.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm aware that not portraying murder of children is a societal norm.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm also aware that societal norms change all the time and for the good reasons as well.	NoArgument	test

video games				My position is a position of freedom.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't usually kill innocent NPCs, but I know a guy who killed and ate every NPC in Fallout New Vegas.	NoArgument	test

video games				And while rape simulators deserve adult only rating for obvious adult only content, I just don't see why killing children is adult only thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some people find it wrong?	NoArgument	test
video games				They are free to not kill children then, its an optional thing, just like killing civilian NPCs.	NoArgument	test
video games				They aren't free to say "nobody should be allowed to kill children in video games, so let's effectively blacklist every game with this feature"	NoArgument	test
video games				Does the ESRB ACTUALLY have a problem with child killing, to the point of an AO?	NoArgument	test
video games				Fallout 1/2 has children that can die or be killed by the player, and it got an M rating.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that's an older game, of course.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've always assumed lack of children like this had much more to do with self censorship, a desire to avoid controversy and the fact that some countries in Europe won't allow it (I know children were patched out of Fallout 1/2 for this reason in Europe) than the ESRB.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm almost certain that it'd get a game an AO, yes.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's why Bioshock wouldn't show you harvesting the Little Sisters.	NoArgument	test
video games				That makes me think we're all just guessing that's the case, as I'm not aware of a single game actually getting an AO for it or censoring/rereleasing to drop down to an M.	NoArgument	test
video games				Deus Ex Invisible War is another one where you can kill children and it got an M...	NoArgument	test
video games				But again, it's older (2003 though, only 4 years from Bioshock).	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm guessing it's now just untested waters no one big has the taste to swim in.	NoArgument	test
video games				Many open world games such as those mentioned still attempt to have their protagonists seen in a favorable light.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you only do the missions as instructed in Assassin’s creed, you’re playing a person who’s killing people who are causing significant harm to the world and thus bringing about some net good.	NoArgument	test
video games				Further, any deviation from this is usually punished, with your health bar taking a hit if you just randomly murder innocent civilians because it causes desynchronization since the ancestor character wasn’t committing murder for shits and giggles and could at least be justified by saying that the protagonist is doing whatever he wants.	NoArgument	test
video games				Murdering children, however, can not at all be seen favorably at all, as neither the ancestor would never have done so (not without being clearly evil in such a situation) nor would the protagonist as that’s sick even for a simulation and really against the point of their mission in the story.	NoArgument	test
video games				Further, what point would there be for the animus to include children in an environment unless critically needed such as with important child characters in the history?	NoArgument	test
video games				Even in GTA 4, Niko is made human and is really typically restrained in some sense to justify his actions within the story.	NoArgument	test
video games				Him killing civilians makes him much more of a worse human being, but this is in contrast to the crappy world that GTA is in and thus few people really being all that good, however children are generally regarded as innocent and it would be inconsistent to Niko’s character to have the option of him gunning down children.

video games				What I’m trying to say is that the company is likely knowledgeable that there are a fair amount of kids who play the game, so they don’t want to take any steps that will make the game more relatable for kids or anything (such as adding kids into the game) in hopes to perhaps deter them.

video games				As someone who has been in esports for the past 15 years, this is false.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is not uncommon to have 10-14 hour ginds for days or even a week+ at a time.	NoArgument	test
video games				...and it is not uncommon to see less.	NoArgument	test
video games				It depends entirely on the game & the players in question.	NoArgument	test
video games				OP's argument is that he and his buddies play a variety of games for 15h at a time, so therefore that's what pro gamers must do too, which isn't correct.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sure you wont play "a variety" of games, but you will probably play 1.	NoArgument	test
video games				To say that time spent playing isn't an issue in the industry is just false because the idea of grind is almost ingrained into the culture and extremely prevalent.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're arguing against a point that I'm not making.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nowhere did I say that "time spent playing isn't an issue in the industry."  I'm questioning the OP's flawed assertion in its support of his larger view.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Many pro gamers play only 6-10h a day of dedicated, structured practice towads their game of choice.	NoArgument	test
video games				?	NoArgument	test
video games				Is this not your assertion?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because this is a false assertion, especially for kids that are not apart of a team already and are trying to get onto on.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes many of the top "pro" players that are on teams will play those hours, but for kids that are just coming up 12 hour days are literally the norm.	NoArgument	test
video games				Its a semantic game because technically people don't play many games they play 1, and technically yes the pros do play less, but only if they are already at the top level of the game and only if they are actually apart of a major team.	NoArgument	test
video games				The vast majority of semi-pro or t2/3 pro players are playing more than the 6-10 a day.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Many pro gamers play only 6-10h a day of dedicated, structured practice towads their game of choice.	NoArgument	test
video games				>   >?	NoArgument	test
video games				>   >Is this not your assertion?	NoArgument	test
video games				Does that say "time spent playing is not an issue in the industry?"  Does the word "many" actually mean "all?"   >Yes many of the top "pro" players that are on teams will play those hours but for kids that are just coming up 12 hour days are literally the norm.	NoArgument	test
video games				Does the sentence you quoted not say "Many **pro gamers**?" Does it say "Many kids that are just coming up?"  &#x200B;  OP's line that I'm refuting:  > I'm quite good at the games I play and indeed I would say the majority of the people I play with (admittedly skewed by the fact those who play the most are the most likely to be on) play a ludicrous amount of games.	NoArgument	test
video games				That statement is *all* that I'm arguing against.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am not asserting my own point here.	NoArgument	test
video games				> My problem is that to have a chance at making it as a gamer, the amount of hours required far exceeds traditional sports and most art forms as well.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you have any evidence for that claim beyond your anecdotal experience?	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm a competitive Super Smash Bros.	NoArgument	test
video games				player (XzibitA if you want proof), and some of the people I know that compete at the highest level don't actually play the game all that frequently.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's actually [evidence](https://bulletproofmusician.com/how-many-hours-a-day-should-you-practice/) to support the idea that practice doesn't provide a benefit past a certain point of activity per day.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Certainly no child is likely to spend 14 hours a day practicing music without rigid discipline from parents.	NoArgument	test
video games				My good sir, I don't believe you've heard the story of the magnificent john frusciante.	NoArgument	test
video games				> But playing 14 hours of basketball a day just isn't possible  That's true, but in order to devote your life to basketball it will basically take up your whole day.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have to train in the gym, see nutritionists...etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, what do you feel about other professional competitions like Chess?	NoArgument	test
video games				You could play Chess for 14 hours a day and have probably about the same odds of making it big.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's funny you should mention chess actually.	NoArgument	test
video games				I played chess on the junior circuit for a few years.	NoArgument	test
video games				I was never amazing, but I could certainly hold my own in county tournaments.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's actually an excellent illustrator of my point.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no idea in chess that the endgame is fame, glory and riches.	NoArgument	test
video games				The people playing are playing with the goal of becoming better at chess, not of "making it".	NoArgument	test
video games				This means that apart from a few hot-housing incidents over the decades, *there just haven't really been kids voluntarily playing chess for 14 hours a day*.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it would be the same for video games in a world where becoming an e-athlete was not an option and there were no mega-prizes or glorified lifestyles at the top.	NoArgument	test
video games				> There is no idea in chess that the endgame is fame, glory and riches.	NoArgument	test
video games				The people playing are playing with the goal of becoming better at chess, not of "making it".	NoArgument	test
video games				This is a fair point.	NoArgument	test
video games				Chess was a poor example.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let me see if I understand your argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are three qualities about esports that you take issue with:  1.	NoArgument	test
video games				It requires an immense amount of practice to get good.	NoArgument	test
video games				2.	NoArgument	test
video games				The chances of becoming pro are very, very slim.	NoArgument	test
video games				3.	NoArgument	test
video games				Kids want and are obsessed to get very, very good.	NoArgument	test
video games				The result is a bunch of kids spending a ton of time pursuing something they are likely to never achieve.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think this is fair.	NoArgument	test
video games				My Chess example was poor because it failed to meet criteria 3.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I still think something like basketball meets all the criteria.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are kids who spend all their days getting better at basketball.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even though practice may only be a few hours, they still have weightlifting and watching tapes.	NoArgument	test
video games				They consciously think about what they eat at every meal.	NoArgument	test
video games				They take naps and go to bed early.	NoArgument	test
video games				And even when they're not doing anything directly about basketball, they're *thinking* about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you take issue with this?	NoArgument	test
video games				>The people playing are playing with the goal of becoming better at chess, not of "making it".	NoArgument	test
video games				This means that apart from a few hot-housing incidents over the decades, *there just haven't really been kids voluntarily playing chess for 14 hours a day*.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's simply not true, while competitive chess is much less popular than most other sports comparatively, GMs & particularly GMs who started young (such as Magnus Carlson), absolutely practiced 12+ hours a day.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Fischer, Magnus, Hou Yifan, Caplanca, ect...)	NoArgument	test
video games				Firstly, I feel like pro-gamers (pgs) and streamers need to be differentiated.	NoArgument	test
video games				Often times pgs are streamers but that's not always the case.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's take for example Ninja since you brought up fortnite.	NoArgument	test
video games				He is the typical pg streamer who plays 12+ hours a day.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, you don't need to play or practice that much to be a pg.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example Faker who is considered one of the best players in League of Legends in the world admits he doesn't let League interfere with his workout and family time .	NoArgument	test
video games				It's up to everyone to understand what kind of career they want and what time management skills they need to have.	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe wholly in the rights of adults to engage in whatever behaviour they see fit.	NoArgument	test
video games				My problem is children who can't see the bigger picture are being sold dreams of grandeur in esports which leads to them sacrificing proper childhood development.	NoArgument	test
video games				Indeed, I can certainly say in my youth I began to replace people with video games and it stunted my social development.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah but children don't pick their schedule and get sold dreams of grandeur everywhere.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like acting modelling singing rapping.	NoArgument	test
video games				Children also don't buy their own PCs and games.	NoArgument	test
video games				> children don't pick their schedule  Indeed, "get off the damn xbox" is a battle had by parents all over the world.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think that the esports industry is partially responsible for making this such a common point of contention however.	NoArgument	test
video games				The kids/teens who feel that their parents just "don't understand games" versus the parents who, in all fairness probably don't understand games but can see the negative effects they have.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's a difference between "get off the Xbox" and being a parent who can take the Xbox away from misuse.	NoArgument	test
video games				You gotta have that conversation and be like "are you trying to go pro?" What do you need and how can you balance your schedule.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not even about understanding games or not..	NoArgument	test
video games				it's about educating kids on time management, future prep and goals.	NoArgument	test
video games				Isn’t being a professional soccer player basically the similar odds and requires similar dedication?	NoArgument	test
video games				Soccer does indeed require a lot of dedication, however it's very difficult to invest yourself entirely in professional sports without leaving room for normal childhood development.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are physical barriers (your athleticism), and a lot more overwatch from adults who are used to handling children with dreams of stardom to guide them.	NoArgument	test
video games				So if gaming had adult guidance that would solve the issue you see?	NoArgument	test
video games				Theoretically, but the format of videogames doesn't really allow that.	NoArgument	test
video games				If gaming were something you could only do when you went to *the videogames club* at your local town that was structured like a traditional sports club, I would absolutely argue that it may well be a beneficial and enjoyable use of kids' time.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not objecting to the activity in the slightest otherwise I wouldn't do it for ~10 hours per week.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm just objecting to the lifestyle that is glorified as obtainable for kids.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is the lifestyle of a high school athlete that much better?	NoArgument	test
video games				3hr practices, potential for severe injuries (brain damage if American football) and very low chance of a college scholarship?	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel like gaming is one of many potentially lucrative hobbies that people obsess over.	NoArgument	test
video games				In reality these hobbies are just lottery tickets.	NoArgument	test
video games				What’s the difference between that and any other career?	NoArgument	test
video games				You say that this doesn't give useful skills, but if a kid can play Fortnite for 15 hours a day every day for a long period of time, that's an insane work ethic for a child, everything in moderation, but a kid pulling off those hours every single day with develop incredible mental fortitude.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or it's a sign of addiction/depression.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've had something similar.	NoArgument	test
video games				As someone who has been there, it was absolutely reflective of an unhealthy coping mechanism rather than a work ethic.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am not at all studious.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think "marketing" is much of a factor in kids playing video games nonstop.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's pretty much just the 'having fun' part that is doing that.	NoArgument	test
video games				> **the marketing that treats 14 hours of video games a day as a viable career encourages children to spend unhealthy amounts of time playing games in persuit of "going pro"**   Maybe I've been out of the loop...but which market encourages kids to play 14 hours a day to get pro?	NoArgument	test
video games				If I understand you right - your point is that esport has become more popular and that kid may try to go pro, but that unlike traditional sport in which you can only play so much in a day, in games kid could train much more to the point that's literally all they do in their life except sleeping and it will become a hinder to their development.	NoArgument	test
video games				To begin with the obvious....How does a kid find 14 hours a day to play games?	NoArgument	test
video games				In holiday perhaps, but in general the kid won't have those 14 hours.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course, maybe I'm missing the point of your argument here.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I suppose what I'm saying is that the sacrifice to go pro at videogames is unreasonable, and for the masses who never make it leads to a poor diet, lack of hygeine or socialisation    Which sacrifices exactly?	NoArgument	test
video games				Also for diet, hygiene and socialisation...Well a lot of game are quite social.	NoArgument	test
video games				Furthermore anyway, if the kid go to school, then it's there he will get most of his socialisation - with his school friends.	NoArgument	test
video games				Finally for diet and hygiene - I thought we were speaking about kids?	NoArgument	test
video games				The diet and the hygiene of a kid is the responsibility of his parents.	NoArgument	test
video games				Furthermore, when someone aims for pro, they think they have a chance.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, one interesting thing is that it is probably easier in esport to realize you can't do it and give up.	NoArgument	test
video games				In competitive video game, you generally have clear, continent-wide or world wide ranking and metrics to measure your performance.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can see well enough where you stand and how much you improve.	NoArgument	test
video games				So if you realize you are good and that you manage to get better and better, you may work hard for it...until it no longer works anymore.	NoArgument	test
video games				And in most cases it doesn't take that long until you realize you aren't good enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a kid realizes he no longer improves, he will stop playing the game all by himself.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, in traditional sport - or worse, in litterature, art, music and others - you can't really know where you stand.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can work hard, compare yourself to your peers, rely on the experience of your elders, but ultimately you have no real way to know where you stand compared to all other people wanting to go pro throughout the country, continent or even the whole world.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thus, it is much easier to keep the illusion that yeah, you can go pro if you keep working hard enough.	NoArgument	test
video games				How is this different than regular sports?	NoArgument	test
video games				My experience is that if you leave kids unchecked, that they'll play video games for 15 hours a day regardless of what kind of money they could maybe earn in the future.	NoArgument	test
video games				Kids are really bad at contemplating the future consequences of their actions so it's up to their parents to limit their gaming time if it starts getting excessive, just like with everything else.	NoArgument	test
video games				>for the masses who never make it leads to a poor diet, lack of hygeine or socialisation (14 hours a day of games minus 6-8 hours of sleep leaves little room for that), a lack of useful real-world skills, and usually doesn't have a happy end.	NoArgument	test
video games				In most cases things never get this far.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just like a kid who thinks they have a shot at becoming a pro athlete, it will become apparent that they aren't competitive enough and they will shift their interests on their own.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most kids come to understand what their limitations are, that's just a basic part of growing up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or, if their physical or mental health does start to slip, parents and teachers are likely to intervene before things get worse.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just like anything else kids might become obsessed with, the problem is never the nature of their obsession but with the lack of care or support from others.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the sedentary aspect and how unhealthy it is, is not a valid argument against it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most jobs are sedentary and they have nothing to do with video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people go to a 9-5 job, sit down, work, then go home to sit some more.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only difference is that people who try to make video games a viable career path probably enjoy it much more then the average guy who does what is expected of them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just like a person who wants to create art, play sports, or something else.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not that video games are sedentary are the problem it's the fact that people don't make time to work out regardless of their career.	NoArgument	test
video games				Unfortunately I don't think this is a good comparison.	NoArgument	test
video games				One of my main objections about video games is that it does not provide participants with employable skills.	NoArgument	test
video games				My objection wasn't purely just to the sedentary nature of games, but rather that this is one aspect where video games fall where traditional sports are excellent.	NoArgument	test
video games				Committing yourself to sports and failing leaves you much fitter than the average person.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here there just isn't any reward for it at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				True but being fit doesn't make you more employable in most jobs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not to mention you are more likely to severally hurt yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Besides depending on what kind of pro gamer you are you can get some decent skills out of it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you're a streamer you learn video/audio editing skills, oratory skills, and production skills.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not to mention you learn to work on a schedule and stuck with it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you're a tournament gamer though, the skills you get from that are shockingly similar to what you get from sports.	NoArgument	test
video games				Leadership abilities, team working, dedication, and so on.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only difference is how fit you are and that can be easily fixed by going to the gym.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also if you haven't noticed most pro gamers aren't overweight.	NoArgument	test
video games				!delta    I hadn't considered the other skills that gamers are likely to get as well.	NoArgument	test
video games				Indeed this rings true for me because I did in fact do the Youtube thing for a while and now am skilled at video editing and audio mixing.	NoArgument	test
video games				I also wasn't giving enough credence to the teamwork aspect.	NoArgument	test
video games				Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/AndracoDragon ([1∆](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/AndracoDragon)).	NoArgument	test

video games				American civil law does not really emphasize personal responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				In theory you could make a lawn mower with no guard, where the blade was just exposed.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you could say "obviously anyone can see there's no guard.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they cut themselves it's 100% their own fault."  But our courts don't see it that way.	NoArgument	test
video games				They see it as unacceptably negligent to make that product.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you're profiting off kids stealing their parents' cards; you know that's where your income is coming from; and you take absolutely no precautions to prevent it - then the legal argument "it's their own fault" doesn't get you far.	NoArgument	test
video games				As interesting as this is, mines wasn't an legal, but moral argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here in the UK, I have no idea if it would work as you described.	NoArgument	test
video games				In any case, modern gaming consoles have a number of features that prevent misuse by children.	NoArgument	test
video games				[In this example, the owner of the Switch admitted he could have used the PIN feature to lock his children out from making purchases across three weeks.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48908766)  I'd too imagine that those companies are probably aware that some of their profits might come from kids using their parent's stolen cards (same way, I suppose any toy company in the past figured the same about their products), but they're certainly not encouraging it either.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yet the government that still makes credit cards legal tender and doesn't ban them can somehow not be sued for this nor the credit card company.	NoArgument	test
video games				Both could see this happening; credit cards provide almost zero checks to stop this from happening; credit card fraud is a common occurence because it's so simple and consequently US-style credit cards are banned in many countries because of this but continue to thrive in the US.	NoArgument	test
video games				u/D-Rez there's obviously a third road here: if the blame can lie with the company for having no sufficient safeguards it can also lie with the credit card company and the government for either implementing such a fraud-sensitive system or for even keeping it legal respectively in the first place.	NoArgument	test
video games				And how do you propose that companies make it harder for kids to abuse their parents credit card?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because I think it's pretty secure as it is if you aren't a dumbass that allows their kid to have easy access to their money.	NoArgument	test
video games				When kids were spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on 900 numbers it caused families problems that would radiate out to society at large by creating issues where families would have their credit ruined, be unable to secure car loans, be unable to rent or buy shelter, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				To solve the problem created by the bad actors running 900 numbers, Congress [passed a law](https://priceonomics.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-1-900-number/) that did a number of things, including restricting companies from doing certain types of debt collection for 900 number bills and requiring companies to immediately refund any 900 number charges while payment disputes were negotiated.	NoArgument	test
video games				The problem basically disappeared overnight because running a 900 number was no longer a viable business.	NoArgument	test
video games				But note--Congress didn't legislate 900 numbers out of existence.	NoArgument	test
video games				They killed themselves by behaving so irresponsibly as to draw Congressional attention.	NoArgument	test
video games				Game companies have had a chance to address the problems with loot boxes and have chosen to do nothing to regulate themselves.	NoArgument	test
video games				It should be surprising to no one that Congress may wish to regulate what they believe to be predatory or unfair business practices regardless of whether they are classified as gambling or not.	NoArgument	test
video games				The main driver behind loot boxes is the ever-increasing piece of the pie publishers are demanding as well as patently unrealistic profit expectations and stupidly soaring budgets for AAA games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even a few small changes, practiced industry-wide, could have diverted the attention of legislators away from the gaming industry for a few more years.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sticking to cosmetics, putting up the odds of winning difference prizes at the outset, sticking to a reasonable pricing model, offering reasonable ways of cancelling unwanted transactions--all of those things could have made the lootbox situation a non-issue for much longer.	NoArgument	test
video games				It didn't have to be this way.	NoArgument	test
video games				But like with the 900 number scam artists who ruined the 900 number business model for everyone, the games industry is treading dangerously close to a Congressional overcorrection by behaving irresponsibly towards their customers and their own employees with these insane profit expectations and unrealistic capital investment.	NoArgument	test
video games				What you are saying is true, but how is this relevant to OP's view?	NoArgument	test
video games				OP is saying this current predatory practice of the gaming industry is morally sound (not really a view about government intervention/regulation) in the same sense that lottery tickets don't get any backlash.	NoArgument	test
video games				Only those who are willing, will play.	NoArgument	test
video games				No one forces you to play stupid games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Whether or not government should regulate this industry behavior or is trending towards getting regulated is not really what OP has a problem with.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like the 900 numbers, a few bad apples who go way beyond what is ethical or reasonable are drawing increased attention to what would normally be seen as benign at best or a personal moral failing that people should just suffer over at worst.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm drawing a comparison between a thing that happened in the past and what is happening now.	NoArgument	test
video games				It has nothing to do with personal responsibility of average people--it's the edge cases that draw attention.	NoArgument	test
video games				Should games rated E by the esrb, have a storefront that is directly tied to the gameplay interface without any explicit verification?	NoArgument	test
video games				One where a kid has direct access to?	NoArgument	test
video games				Where buying and playing are seemlessly integrated and where often in game currency is intermingled with real life currency (usually as another version of some game money)?	NoArgument	test
video games				It seems like the gaming storefronts tend to be explicitly designed to get people to impulse buy.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is that really a game feature that reflects an "everyone" rating?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it’s helpful to differentiate between “regular purchases” online and online gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s true that it’s ultimately parents’ responsibility to check their children’s expenses - especially so if they use a parent’s credit card.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I do agree with the argument that gambling specifically directed towards children (because embedded into game mechanics as “surprise events” or whatever) should be much more heavily regulated or preferably banned.	NoArgument	test
video games				Many countries already regulate gambling to various degrees (crucially enforcing minimum age restrictions) and just haven’t caught onto this new form of online gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				In that sense these companies are definitely exploiting a loophole, are acting predatorily and are responsible for this phenomenon.	NoArgument	test
video games				Should loot boxes be banned or not, is a bit outside the scope of what I want my view changed on.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if loot boxes stopped existing, there's still a plethora of other things you could buy instead.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that said, Pokemon cards were a big part of my childhood, if loot boxes ought to be heavily regulated, so should those.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's very likely going to hurt more innocent and responsible people, than actually target those who cannot be trusted.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, regular shopping seems fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				But creating addictive, endorphin-boosting gambling mechanics is a different issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don’t know much about Pokémon cards.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is there an element of chance involved?	NoArgument	test
video games				If not then this is a pretty clear cut case.	NoArgument	test
video games				But even if there is it should be possible to address the much more pressing issue of online gambling without regard for some past collectible card games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Identifying gaming companies as irresponsible, exploitative actors in principle should be even easier.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Again, regular shopping seems fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				But creating addictive, endorphin-boosting gambling mechanics is a different issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't think people can't get a rush from even regular shopping?	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't think that too can be addictive?	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't think retailers don't also play tricks to extract as much money from you as possible?	NoArgument	test
video games				> I don’t know much about Pokémon cards.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is there an element of chance  involved?	NoArgument	test
video games				If not then this is a pretty clear cut case.	NoArgument	test
video games				But even if there  is it should be possible to address the much more pressing issue of  online gambling without regard for some past collectible card games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, there is an element of chance involved, and last I hear, they are still being sold.	NoArgument	test
video games				If not, then there is still the MTG scene, which I know is still huge at least.	NoArgument	test
video games				The reason Pokemon and other **T**CGs are a different case than lootboxes, even though they share the same unseen random chance, is that T means Trading.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can trade, buy and sell individual Pokemon cards.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't do that with digital lootboxes, the only way to acquire what you want from them is to keep giving money to the company for gambling chances.	NoArgument	test
video games				The items in lootboxes don't have any transferable value either.	NoArgument	test
video games				I thought you could sell all of that stuff on Steam?	NoArgument	test
video games				I bought a few skins for PUBG.	NoArgument	test
video games				But OP’s argument is even more true if there is no actual market for this product.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now you are not paying for a chance of winning something hopefully greater in value than what you are paying, but rather you are simply paying for the experience of opening the loot box itself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Without a market, all rewards are equally worthless.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is no more gambling than tossing a coin in a fountain.	NoArgument	test
video games				No, value is determined solely by the spender.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cash does t have any value by itself, it's the value you place on it that gives it worth.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you truly trying to wiggle in a debate over fiat money?	NoArgument	test
video games				That has nothing to do with the issue at hand:  Wagering (fiat 🙄) money in hopes of receiving something more valuable based on an uncertain outcome.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, if this more valuable reward is more money or something exchangeable or tenderable like money, that is gambling by definition.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if the reward has no worth at all, regardless of how you value it, it is not gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				You are simply paying the company for a bit of non-exchangable, non-tenderable, non-valuable outside of yourself data.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's all irrelevant to wether or not the company is responsible for preying on people with gambling addictions, or whether or not they try to pressure you spend money on their product.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well first, every company is trying to pressure you to spend money on their product.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are pushy salespeople now the equivalent of slot machines?	NoArgument	test
video games				And the issue people have with lootboxes is not the people with gambling addictions being targeted, but the children who are being manipulated to spend money.	NoArgument	test
video games				If these lootboxes could **only be acquired via in-game currency**, no one would have an issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				The issue people have is this supposed underhanded way the games can get kids to part with their parents’ money.	NoArgument	test
video games				Which, if the parents paid a modicum of attention to their child, would not even be an issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				You absolutely can trade and sell CSGO, TF2 and DOTA2 loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Those are the only exceptions and not what people are complaining about when they complain about greedy companies exploiting peoples gambling addictions.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why would those games be different from, say, Fortnite?	NoArgument	test
video games				When it comes to "exploiting peoples gambling addictions"?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because you can buy the specific item you want, instead of having to gamble for it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you believe that being able to directly buy skins will cause kids to stop using their parent's credit cards?	NoArgument	test
video games				>In my view, the fault is almost always, and almost entirely, on the parents for leaving their card details on the devices, only to be accessed by their children.  These aren't always obvious, especially to less tech savvy individuals.  The options for saving your credit card info are done very similar to the way bloatware is tacked onto downloads.  It appears as an option as you are making your purchase and is designed in such a way as to get more people to save their credit card info so that they will make more purchases.  If there was no benefit to the company, that option would not be there.   Here's an anecdote.  When my cousin was 5 he stole over $100 from his dad's wallet. They thought they lost it and were looking everywhere for it because they were going to go out as a family that month and that was all the extra spending money they had.  Eventually they found he had it and everything ended up being alright.  He was unable to spend it because, again, he was 5.  In most cases he would need his parents to take him somewhere where he could spend it.  Even then, if a child went into a store alone and tried to spend a $100 he would stopped by the cashier and they would figure out why a child has so much money.    That doesn't happen now that we are moving into digital spaces.  There are way fewer steps.  These lack of additional safeguards are a net benefit for businesses as there are less employees to pay to maintain physical spaces and there are less steps involved in getting a customer to part with their money.  All these sites could add a pin needed to access a saved credit card.  They don't.  They don't because they believe it is a net increase in profit.  Most are willing to refund erroneous purchases and take the blame because they believe that A) they aren't actually losing any money and B) are actually making more money because they are avoiding further scrutiny and regulation that would come with being the business that accepted $100 from a 5 year old.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think your view is kind of missing the point of the whole debate.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not about assigning blame to a specific party.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's the whether or not games with micro transactions (namely, pay-to-win gatcha mechanics) should have additional restrictions.	NoArgument	test
video games				And if so, what should they be?	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you believe parental controls aren't enough, or just underused?	NoArgument	test
video games				Probably both.	NoArgument	test
video games				However, I can't speak on an individual app level.	NoArgument	test
video games				When parents buy a £40 game for their children they just had ant to put it in and let them play.	NoArgument	test
video games				They shouldn't have to worry about going bankrupt cause children can easily spend huge amounts of money.	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel the companies hold some responsibility to put some basic safeguards in place that should be accessed while making the purchase.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they do that they sent totally to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				That being said many of these games have 3+ rating and are targeting children with mechanics that are very close to gambleing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambleing can wreck the lives of adults but companies are free to target children because technically it's not gambleing because you always win something?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yea I don't think they can absolve responsibility for everything	NoArgument	test
video games				> I feel the companies hold some responsibility to put some basic safeguards in place that should be accessed while making the purchase.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they do that they sent totally to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				That does appear to have happened at least in this case: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48908766  Guy was aware of the PIN feature on the Switch, but didn't bother setting it up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Three weeks later, he got a "surprise mechanic" of his own.	NoArgument	test
video games				Fault isn't 100%.	NoArgument	test
video games				It can be shared.	NoArgument	test
video games				Parents can share fault, alongside the kids who might be old enough, but companies are also willing not to put in features that might block additional purchases.	NoArgument	test
video games				They also make games for kids that tantalize them into buying online goodies and there's nothing parents can do to stop that exposure.	NoArgument	test
video games				Limit, sure, but not stop.	NoArgument	test
video games				The issue isn’t with the money that’s being spent, the issue is its enabling addictive behavior	NoArgument	test
video games				Here's how I see it:  If a 13 year old kid goes into a retail store and walks up to the counter with hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars worth of electronic/gaming equipment and tries to pay with a credit card, with no adults with him - the store would refuse to sell him the products.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why?	NoArgument	test
video games				He has a valid method of payment, right?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because most 13 year olds do not have hundreds of dollars or even their own credit card, so obviously something is "wrong" here, and the cashier declines to make the transaction.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it actually IS a valid transaction, the parents can come in and straighten it out.	NoArgument	test
video games				Better to "hassle" one or two legitimate transactions than go through with dozens of fraudulent ones and then have to go through the refund fight with all those customers.	NoArgument	test
video games				Our data is all over, and it's certainly being collected by video game companies, so they KNOW their playerbase.	NoArgument	test
video games				They have the data to see that xXxJohnnyBoy07xXx is a 13 year old kid, so they should do the same thing that retail stores do: decline to make a large transaction with him when he attempts to initiate it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, if it actually is valid, the parents can call up and get it to go through.	NoArgument	test
video games				Where you set the limit, I guess someone has to figure out.	NoArgument	test
video games				But at the very least it should be flagged when someone is making more than just "minimal purchases" on an account until it's verified that it's actually an adult (or someone with permission to) before processing those transactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				By not doing this, I would say the gaming companies ARE responsible for these kids running up huge transactions, because they aren't declining to sell to them like their retail brick-and-mortar counterparts do.	NoArgument	test
video games				> They have the data to see that xXxJohnnyBoy07xXx is a 13 year old kid  What data do you think is being shared between the end-user, first party, and the game studio that would let them know every user's age?	NoArgument	test
video games				Especially with GDPR and other growing privacy concerns?	NoArgument	test
video games				> Again, if it actually is valid, the parents can call up and get it to go through.	NoArgument	test
video games				How would you manage this transaction?	NoArgument	test
video games				In the US at least, a credit card is a valid form of age confirmation.	NoArgument	test
video games				Would you require parents to actually call a phone number staffed by the developer?	NoArgument	test
video games				Would an email or text response suffice?	NoArgument	test
video games				How would you make sure any options can't also be hijacked by the kid who is already stealing their parent's credit card / committing fraud?	NoArgument	test
video games				> Our data is all over, and it's certainly being collected by video game companies, so they KNOW their playerbase.	NoArgument	test
video games				The parents of xXxJohnnyBoy07xXx could have been making purchases on his behalf at various times, if they left their card details to be readily accessed by anyone turning on the Xbox, how can they tell if the next purchase is made by xXxJohnnyBoy07xXx, or his dad?	NoArgument	test
video games				Me thinks you're overestimating the predictive power of the data they collect.	NoArgument	test
video games				The difference between this, and the brick 'n mortar store example, is that the cashier can obviously tell a 13 year old from a grown-up just by their face alone.	NoArgument	test
video games				I have to ask the same thing almost everyone posted here, why isn't the parental access features on these consoles enough?	NoArgument	test
video games				Just by using them, it would have prevented probably the majority of these cases.	NoArgument	test
video games				If someone intentionally makes a product as addictive as possible, and as a result some people get addicted and do improper things to get funding for it, should the creator of the product have any liability?	NoArgument	test
video games				In other words, should game companies make their game deliberately less fun?	NoArgument	test
video games				People find Witcher 3 fun and addictive, despite not having any MTX or skins or the like, should CDPR have made that game more boring to prevent addiction?	NoArgument	test
video games				please respond to the actual statement I made, not a questionable reinterpretation of it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Every video game company makes their games as fun as possible, you're asking should creators be blamed for creating a too enjoyable product.	NoArgument	test
video games				If my interpretation is wrong, please correct me, because that looks like what you're saying.	NoArgument	test
video games				what I meant is exactly what I said.	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't need to "interpret" it at all; especially by changing the words used.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, I used the word "addictive" not "fun".	NoArgument	test
video games				While there's substantial overlap, they're not the same thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Please answer the question as asked, I chose the exact wording I did for a reason, and I meant exactly that, not something else.	NoArgument	test

video games				When people say The Witcher is addictive, they just mean that it's fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				No one out there is actually addicted to the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meanwhile, the games that people develop *actual* addictions to are near universally those with a business model based on recurrent spending, whether MTX or subscription fees, because they have a financial incentive to be that way.	NoArgument	test
video games				And those games do actually go out of their way to be less fun, in order to incentivize spending.	NoArgument	test
video games				> When people say The Witcher is addictive, they just mean that it's fun.	NoArgument	test
video games				No one out there is actually addicted to the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they can still be addicted to single-player video games, right?	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not impossible to imagine someone might still lose sleep, work, or other important duties from video games, even if they do not have any loot boxes, collectable skins, or even any MP function?	NoArgument	test
video games				You seem to have missed the important part of the op, let me repeat it for you:  *If someone intentionally makes a product as addictive as possible, and as a result some people get addicted and **do improper things to get funding for it**, should the creator of the product have any liability?*  Do you acknowledge the difference between a game you buy once and be addicted to for no direct extra costs and a game specifically designed to make spending more money an elemental part of the addicting expirience?	NoArgument	test

video games				>If someone intentionally makes a product as addictive as possible, and as a result some people get addicted and do improper things to get funding for it, should the creator of the product have any liability?	NoArgument	test
video games				Seeing as nearly all hobbies require money to pursue, and all are potentially addictive, no.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Do you acknowledge the difference between a  game you buy once and be addicted to for no direct extra costs and a  game specifically designed to make spending more money an elemental part  of the addicting experience?	NoArgument	test
video games				If you do, please answer the actual  question.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like I said in my previous comment, people can still be addicted to the hobby of gaming, and not necessarily to any one game.	NoArgument	test
video games				And none of this challenges my OP, you could make a game as addictive as you want, but if parents kept cards away from their children, and made use of parental access features, this point is entirely moot.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is entirely possible to play these games and not run up your parent's credit card bills.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is it the fault of a casino or the parents if a child goes in with its parents wallet?	NoArgument	test
video games				And how would you feel if the casinos were advertising to children that they should come in with their parents wallets?	NoArgument	test
video games				> And how would you feel if the casinos were advertising to children that they should come in with their parents wallets?	NoArgument	test
video games				Not sure how this would work, seeing as children are almost universally banned from gambling in casinos, with or without their parents.	NoArgument	test
video games				It wouldn't make any sense to target a demographic that they can't allow to spend any money on their premises.	NoArgument	test
video games				>It wouldn't make any sense to target a demographic that they can't allow to spend any money on their premises  Unless they planned on doing it illegaly for profit  > seeing as children are almost universally banned from gambling in casinos  Exactly my point.	NoArgument	test
video games				So why arent children banned from using these apps?	NoArgument	test
video games				If a casino lets a child do it anyway, theyll be fined huge sums of money, maybe lose their license after a few times.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yet nothing happens to a gamedev or appstore doing it.	NoArgument	test
video games				How is this morally different?	NoArgument	test
video games				> Exactly my point.	NoArgument	test
video games				So why arent children banned from using these apps?	NoArgument	test
video games				Because they can still play those game for free, and it's their parents prerogative to decide how much they can spend on those apps, if at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				In a physical casino, you can demand young looking patrons to provide ID.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is no system online that is reliable as that, except credit cards, which again is the parent's responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Because they can still play those game for free  Yeah thats the issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				They shouldnt be able to, without reasonably proving they are old enough to gamble.	NoArgument	test
video games				>There is no system online that is reliable as that  There are a bunch of online systems as reliable as that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people just wouldnt bother to use them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Phone verification for example.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or some of the online banking authentication technologies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everything about credit cards and appstores is designed to be convenient and quick to use, to get you to spend money without thinking too long about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe some of that design needs to be rolled back for children.	NoArgument	test
video games				And credit cards wont be anytime soon, so its on the appstores.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not to mention that even if it were banned but ineffectively enforced, the part about advertising of gambling to children, which is the main problem, would still be gone.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Everything about credit cards and appstores is designed to be convenient and quick to use, to get you to spend money without thinking too long about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe some of that design needs to be rolled back for children.	NoArgument	test
video games				And credit cards wont be anytime soon, so its on the appstores.	NoArgument	test
video games				On one hand, we could implement a new system that makes it harder for kids, at a slight cost of convenience to legitimate users.	NoArgument	test
video games				But would it not simply be a better solution for all, if parents to keep their cards away from easy access, and to use the parental access tools on offer?	NoArgument	test
video games				With almost every story about this I can find about kids using their parents cards for gaming, I can't help but note there clearly were already very simple things the parents could have done, to prevent getting a huge shock the next time they go through their bank outgoings?	NoArgument	test
video games				Elsewhere, I linked to a story where the guy admitted he was aware of the Switch's PIN function, but didn't bother to set one up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe thats me being biased against the entire industry, but i dont view convenience to the legitimate user here as such a big problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				I wouldnt shed a tear if microtransaction in apps cease to exist because it was too bothersome for legitimate users.	NoArgument	test
video games				I certainly dont view it as more important than the brainwashing and hooking of children.	NoArgument	test
video games				So not so much a matter of too hard to do, but rather of your company is not allowed to operate unless you figure out a way.	NoArgument	test
video games				I can commend you for your honesty.	NoArgument	test
video games				I suspect most people share your views, but dress up their personal loathing of the business model as something else.	NoArgument	test
video games				Personally indifferent to it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Exactly.	NoArgument	test
video games				They aren't allowed in for that exact reason.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they were allowed in and were advertised specifically to kids, would it be the casinos fault?	NoArgument	test
video games				I'd say probably, yeah.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Exactly.	NoArgument	test
video games				They aren't allowed in for that exact reason  They're not allowed in, because they're not allowed in?	NoArgument	test
video games				What?	NoArgument	test
video games				They're not allowed in because it was would be predatory, and children can't make the same judgement calls adults can.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's the reason I was refferring to, I think you misunderstood.	NoArgument	test
video games				When you design a game intentionally to extract money from people on a regular basis for what equates to gambling as core part of the game, and also market that game to children, you are already acting immorally.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have created a game that intentionally frustrates children when they don't have copious amounts of money to spend on the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				You needn't qualify the scenario further with credit cards used by children without permission.	NoArgument	test
video games				Charging money from stolen credit cards is illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				The video game companies failed to check authorisation.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m surprised most answers are about what exactly the kid is buying, which is completely irrelevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s the video game companies fault as in they’re going to have to repay the charge.	NoArgument	test
video games				In other senses, it’s the kids fault for stealing, the parent’s fault for carelessness, the credit card company’s fault for inadequate authorisation measures, or the video game company’s fault for addictive products, but really you can philosophically argue either way.	NoArgument	test
video games				Practically, there’s no question about the reimbursement however.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Charging money from stolen credit cards is illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				The video game companies failed to check authorisation.	NoArgument	test
video games				How would you suggest the video game companies or bank can do to ensure the right person is making the purchases?	NoArgument	test
video games				Honestly, I think parental controls already present is enough, it's up to the parents to actually make use of them.	NoArgument	test
video games				In almost every story I seen so far, the parents kinda blame themselves for not taking steps.	NoArgument	test
video games				How about two-factor authentication?	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s common in Sweden.	NoArgument	test
video games				The kids may steal the cards, though they probably won’t steal their parent’s authenticators and codes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Apparently Visa and Mastercard are going to be rolling out TFA for cards in the UK.	NoArgument	test
video games				But given that some parents seemingly didn't lock down the hardware they give to their kids, I don't know if they are going to bother with that, honestly.	NoArgument	test
video games				I understand that Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo already have TFA for their online services too.	NoArgument	test
video games				Disagree.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some companies, like EA, make the process of linking your account with a credit card very easy, so that even a child can do it, not always eith their parents' permission.	NoArgument	test
video games				Moreover, corporations exploit the fact that kids usually don't fully understand the value of money, and as a result, are more likely to spend more.	NoArgument	test
video games				An example from my life: as a present for new year, my parents bought me a DLC for a game, and the credit card information was saved in the account, few months later I used that already exsiting information to buy a few in-game objects.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some games even use psychological pressure on players to invest money.	NoArgument	test
video games				To summarize, just take a brief look on that video: https://youtu.be/xNjI03CGkb4 Just watch the first minute, it was enough for me.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree that it's the parents fault if a child uses their credit card.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nobody would think it was the video game companies fault if kids were stealing paper money to go to the store to buy stuff.	NoArgument	test
video games				With that said, your point about micro transactions is wrong.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes and card packs etc teach kids that gambling is fun and gets them addicted to the thrill at a young age.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again this should be on the parents to talk to their children about but it is still scummy and it's sad to see the video game industry moving in that direction.	NoArgument	test
video games				In the past it looked like it was moving to a valid new art form but the largest companies are ruining that and giving the industry a bad name	NoArgument	test
video games				> With that said, your point about micro transactions is wrong.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes and card packs etc teach kids that gambling is fun and gets them addicted to the thrill at a young age.	NoArgument	test
video games				I disagree with this.	NoArgument	test
video games				As a kid, I played MTG and bought card packs, I used gumball machines, I even bought a geode or two (I never got a purple one).	NoArgument	test
video games				As an adult, I occasionally buy a loot box or two in games, and budget money for gambling when I take trips to Vegas, but I most definitely do not have an addiction to it.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's a fun aside I budget for.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree that numerous things can play to a gambling addiction, but those things only work on someone who has addiction problems, it doesn't create them out of the ether in anyone who is exposed at a young age.	NoArgument	test
video games				So things like free will or agency is bullshit.	NoArgument	test
video games				Anyone telling you otherwise is just trying to scam you.	NoArgument	test
video games				People behave in entirely predictable ways depending on their environment.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you don't believe me, you don't have to look any further than psychology, marketing, etc...	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell, you can even read about studies where condoms had increased price in one city for a week.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you can tract the sharp spike in birth's down to that exact week.	NoArgument	test
video games				Companies know this.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why do you think they do marketing?	NoArgument	test
video games				They have marketing companies that research EVERYTHING you do and how will you react towards anything the company will do.	NoArgument	test
video games				They know exactly how kids will react towards loot boxes in games and what they will do.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let me rephrase your CMV and apply it to another topic and let's see how will it sound.	NoArgument	test
video games				"It's not the fault of the person for raping that girl, she shouldn't have been wearing those slutty clothes".	NoArgument	test
video games				While I don’t actually disagree with most of your post, this part:  > "It's not the fault of the person for raping that girl, she shouldn't have been wearing those slutty clothes".	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel doesn’t really translate to OP’s topic.	NoArgument	test
video games				The game companies aren’t forcing anything on the buyer and the buyer did nothing to attract special attention from the game companies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Their product is just as easy for a child to spend money on as the adult *if the adult put their payment information in.* The fact that children are more vulnerable to particular marketing than the parents should just be extra incentive for the parent to monitor every avenue where the child might spend their money.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now, cases where a child steals their parents’ cards are a different story and should probably be handled on a case by case basis.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a parent suspects a child might do something like this, then the parent should be taking extra steps in the parenting department and the “securing their card” department.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I feel doesn’t really translate to OP’s topic.	NoArgument	test
video games				The game companies aren’t forcing anything on the buyer and the buyer did nothing to attract special attention from the game companies.	NoArgument	test
video games				The point is to show that company know their policies WILL have that affect on children, so they are deflecting the blame somewhere else.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hence my example above.	NoArgument	test
video games				Companies are basically saying that rape is fine, the real issue is the girl's responsibility to dress apropriately.	NoArgument	test
video games				She wouldn't have been raped if only she had some personal responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's her fault that she got raped.	NoArgument	test
video games				The message here : Rape is acceptable.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Their product is just as easy for a child to spend money on as the adult if the adult put their payment information in.	NoArgument	test
video games				The fact that children are more vulnerable to particular marketing than the parents should just be extra incentive for the parent to monitor every avenue where the child might spend their money.	NoArgument	test
video games				As I mentioned above.	NoArgument	test
video games				Legality is nice, but we aren't accusing companies doing ILLEGAL things.	NoArgument	test
video games				We are accusing them of doing IMMORAL things.	NoArgument	test
video games				Sure, it's perfectly okay to market to target children customers from the point of the law.	NoArgument	test
video games				Doesn't mean it should be acceptable.	NoArgument	test
video games				Unlike my example above, marketing to kids isn't illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				As long as you market it to kids via adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				Companies know this, we know this, that doesn't make it okay.	NoArgument	test
video games				As I mentioned above.	NoArgument	test
video games				Free will is BS.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't demand personal responsibility, as we are just as responsible as our environment allows us to be.	NoArgument	test
video games				(basic psychology).	NoArgument	test
video games				Saying that parents should be more responsible is like saying that you should have chosen a better parents.	NoArgument	test
video games				The "Who is to blame?" is absolutely irrelevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				Companies knowingly sell products that have devastating impact on children.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are you saying it's okay for companies knowingly hurting children for the sake of profit?	NoArgument	test
video games				If you answer yes, then I agree with you that it's the responsibility of parents entirely.	NoArgument	test
video games				Ok, I can see your point about blaming the “victims”, although reasonable people may disagree to what degree the parents are victims  Companies have targeted ads at children since forever.	NoArgument	test
video games				We could have a debate that advertisements of this sort have *always* been bad (I think it’s coldly calculated and maybe a little close to the line at times) but what’s happening today in the advertisement industry is really nothing new.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only newer aspect parents must be aware of is the ease of their credit cards being used.	NoArgument	test
video games				But yes, that’s still the parents’ responsibility in my book.	NoArgument	test
video games				> degree the parents are victims  If someone kidnaps your kid it's your fault?	NoArgument	test
video games				After all, you didn't look after them at that exact moment right?	NoArgument	test
video games				>but what’s happening today in the advertisement industry is really nothing new.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not talking about ads, but about loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				I was using ads only as an example of how psychology affects people.	NoArgument	test
video games				>The only newer aspect parents must be aware of is the ease of their credit cards being used.	NoArgument	test
video games				So as I said above.	NoArgument	test
video games				Free will doesn't really exist.	NoArgument	test
video games				If something shows itself to be a problem again and again.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't solve it with advice :D.	NoArgument	test
video games				No matter how much you try to find who is to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have to find external solution.	NoArgument	test
video games				> If someone kidnaps your kid it's your fault?	NoArgument	test
video games				After all, you didn't look after them at that exact moment right?	NoArgument	test
video games				Umm no?	NoArgument	test
video games				I was talking about the case of the kids using the parents’ credit cards without permission.	NoArgument	test
video games				Parents aren’t victims in this case unless maybe the children stole the card/information.	NoArgument	test
video games				And then it starts getting in to a gray area of responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Not talking about ads, but about loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				I was using ads only as an example of how psychology affects people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Same thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				The parents should be aware of these and the ease of how their info can be used to buy them.	NoArgument	test
video games				When my kids start playing online games without me nearby you can be damn sure I’m gonna learn everything I can about the game before I let it happen.	NoArgument	test
video games				> So as I said above.	NoArgument	test
video games				Free will doesn't really exist.	NoArgument	test
video games				If something shows itself to be a problem again and again.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't solve it with advice :D.	NoArgument	test
video games				No matter how much you try to find who is to blame.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have to find external solution.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here’s where I start to disagree.	NoArgument	test
video games				I won’t claim I’ve never been suckered by advertisements before, but people should learn from their mistakes.	NoArgument	test
video games				A responsible parent needs to be aware of what their children are taking an interest in.	NoArgument	test
video games				If there are any dangers involved with it, such as advertising manipulation, the parents need to *try* to be aware of that too, or at the very least, keep a sharp eye and a tight leash on the credit card.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Umm no?	NoArgument	test
video games				I was talking about the case of the kids using the parents’ credit cards without permission.	NoArgument	test
video games				Parents aren’t victims in this case unless maybe the children stole the card/information.	NoArgument	test
video games				And then it starts getting in to a gray area of responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				And I was talking about companies knowingly using methods that will result in "amongst others" kids being in need of money for the loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's examine this concept.	NoArgument	test
video games				Entity A does a bad thing to an entity B.	NoArgument	test
video games				What you are doing is ignoring entity A and placing the responsibility on entity B.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is called victim blaming where victim is held responsible entirely or partialy for the thing that something else did to them.	NoArgument	test
video games				I gave an illustrative example of a kidnapper who did something bad (I hope you think it too) to someone else.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you blame the victim for the act of a kidnapper.	NoArgument	test
video games				Here you are ignoring ENTIRELY the role of the entity that actively and knowingly introduces loot boxes to kids and are fighting every attempt at restricting it.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you instead focus on the responsibility of the parent/child to just be better.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't care about kids stealing from their parents, because that will always happen in environment where kids are incentivize to obtain money for their passion.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Same thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				The parents should be aware of these and the ease of how their info can be used to buy them.	NoArgument	test
video games				When my kids start playing online games without me nearby you can be damn sure I’m gonna learn everything I can about the game before I let it happen.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah, remember when you were a kid and your parents knew everything too?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah good times, parent's these days are just too trusting.	NoArgument	test
video games				>I won’t claim I’ve never been suckered by advertisements before, but people should learn from their mistakes.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can disagree all you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't change the human condition.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have plenty of biases, your mind follow distinct patterns a lot of which we understand and routinely exploit.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't defend against that.	NoArgument	test
video games				You certainly can think you can defend against that, but that's about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a person is for example gambling addict.	NoArgument	test
video games				They can't ever stop gambling if the option of gambling is a permanent factor somewhere close.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a huge amount of literature you can check out about human mind and how really predictable it is.	NoArgument	test
video games				>A responsible parent needs to be aware of what their children are taking an interest in.	NoArgument	test
video games				If there are any dangers involved with it, such as advertising manipulation, the parents need to try to be aware of that too, or at the very least, keep a sharp eye and a tight leash on the credit card.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes and who do you think tries to held these companies accountable?	NoArgument	test
video games				Look, again.	NoArgument	test
video games				Responsibility is ENTIRELY irrelevant if you want to find a solution.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can tell parents all you want how responsible they have to be.	NoArgument	test
video games				And this problem will still prevail.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not because parents won't try, but because parents do the same mistakes as every human and somehow (and I know this is a big fault of parents) they aren't omnipotent and aware of their kids every action.	NoArgument	test
video games				And altho I agree with you that every parents should every day comb through their kids search history, sms messages, facebook posts to make sure the kid isn't up to something, maybe and just maybe.	NoArgument	test
video games				You could remove the reason for the kids behaving that way.	NoArgument	test
video games				> And I was talking about companies knowingly using methods that will result in "amongst others" kids being in need of money for the loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is no different from telling your kids “no” in the store when they want everything in every aisle.	NoArgument	test
video games				Don’t put your credit card info in the field if you don’t want to give your children the chance to buy things without your consent.	NoArgument	test

video games				And you blame the victim for the act of a kidnapper.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, kidnapping is bad but as to your point that they’re the same?	NoArgument	test
video games				Not at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				There’s a difference between criminals forcing themselves on people and companies using dirty advertising.	NoArgument	test
video games				*Some* people *can* look at an advertisement and say “no.”  If you fall for an advertisement, or you leave your payment info available where your children can fall for it, that’s still on you.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes are not much different from baseball or Pokémon cards in that regard, other than they have no resale value.	NoArgument	test
video games				The people who fall for ads aren’t victims, they’re suckers.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’ve fallen for ads myself, so I was a sucker.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Here you are ignoring ENTIRELY the role of the entity that actively and knowingly introduces loot boxes to kids and are fighting every attempt at restricting it.	NoArgument	test

video games				I don't care about kids stealing from their parents, because that will always happen in environment where kids are incentivize to obtain money for their passion.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree the advertising is dirty, but yes the parents are still responsible.	NoArgument	test
video games				The parent could say “If you’re good, I’ll let you buy a couple loot boxes” or “No, you’ve bought enough loot boxes for now”, or “You’ve misbehaved, so no loot boxes for you” or even “Loot boxes are a scam, we’re not buying any.”  You’re acting like the parents have zero agency for this and we need the government to step in and tell us “enough is enough.”  Which is just not true.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Yeah, remember when you were a kid and your parents knew everything too?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah good times, parent's these days are just too trusting.	NoArgument	test
video games				Parents make mistakes.	NoArgument	test
video games				In our online world, they have more to keep track of, but they also have more access to information to stay on top of things.	NoArgument	test
video games				My parents did know when to tell me “no” (most of the time) and I’d like to think I will know to do the same thing when the time comes.	NoArgument	test
video games				I *will* know how to take my credit card information off the line if I think my children might spend money without my consent.	NoArgument	test
video games				You wouldn’t hand all your money to a kid and trust them in a toy store, would you?	NoArgument	test
video games				> You can disagree all you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't change the human condition.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have plenty of biases, your mind follow distinct patterns a lot of which we understand and routinely exploit.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't defend against that.	NoArgument	test
video games				I will know when my child wants to spend money on nonsense, and whether we can afford to indulge in that nonsense.	NoArgument	test
video games				I *can* be in control of my credit card and my child’s access to it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Any mistakes I make (here or in other areas) are on me.	NoArgument	test
video games				> You certainly can think you can defend against that, but that's about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a person is for example gambling addict.	NoArgument	test
video games				They can't ever stop gambling if the option of gambling is a permanent factor somewhere close.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a huge amount of literature you can check out about human mind and how really predictable it is.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well I’m not a gambling addict, and neither is my wife.	NoArgument	test
video games				And I think we can keep our child from spending our money if we think there’s a problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				People with gambling addictions are another conversation.	NoArgument	test
video games				Should we have safeguards in place because they can’t control their impulses?	NoArgument	test
video games				Should we not sell alcohol because alcoholics can’t control themselves?	NoArgument	test
video games				Should we have the government control our wallets because we can’t be trusted to make our own decisions?	NoArgument	test
video games				Where do we draw a line?	NoArgument	test
video games				At what point do you take free will out of someone’s hands if you think they can’t control their behavior?	NoArgument	test
video games				I have to say though, our current government (in the U.S.) is certainly *not* qualified to be answering these questions.	NoArgument	test
video games				>  Yes and who do you think tries to held these companies accountable?	NoArgument	test
video games				> Look, again.	NoArgument	test
video games				Responsibility is ENTIRELY irrelevant if you want to find a solution.	NoArgument	test

video games				And this problem will still prevail.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not because parents won't try, but because parents do the same mistakes as every human and somehow (and I know this is a big fault of parents) they aren't omnipotent and aware of their kids every action.	NoArgument	test
video games				And altho I agree with you that every parents should every day comb through their kids search history, sms messages, facebook posts to make sure the kid isn't up to something, maybe and just maybe.	NoArgument	test
video games				You could remove the reason for the kids behaving that way.	NoArgument	test
video games				How often is this a problem though?	NoArgument	test
video games				We see clickbait pieces like this, and shake our heads and say “There ought to be a law.”  But how bad is this problem?	NoArgument	test
video games				For every parent that’s careless like this, there might be 10 or 20 parents that know *when to remove their payment info.* Thankfully in this case, Nintendo was willing to be nice.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, you and I might disagree on the extent a parent needs to be involved in the child’s social media.	NoArgument	test
video games				A child *does* deserve some privacy, and as long as they’re not able to waste money, some trust should be allowed *on a case by case basis.*  Unfortunately here, some mistakes will be made, but just as a parent *should* have learned some responsibility before having a kid, a kid *needs* to learn some responsibility in their social interactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				This plays back in to a parent being an active participant in their child’s lives and not just relying on the internet or video games to raise them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just as we can’t have the government holding our hands on every little thing, we unfortunately can’t hold our kids’ hands on every little thing (beyond a certain point).	NoArgument	test
video games				So, TLDR:  When it comes to video games and spending money in them, a parent *absolutely* is responsible for their child’s habits.	NoArgument	test
video games				A parent can remove their payment info just as easily as they added it if they’re worried about their kid going crazy with it.	NoArgument	test
video games				New laws don’t suddenly make this possible, it’s already possible.	NoArgument	test
video games				We shouldn’t be relying on legislation or litigation to control our child’s spending habits when we can take the card away.	NoArgument	test
video games				Edit: Fixed a quote	NoArgument	test
video games				> This is no different from telling your kids “no” in the store when they want everything in every aisle.	NoArgument	test
video games				Don’t put your credit card info in the field if you don’t want to give your children the chance to buy things without your consent.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that's once again irrelevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you put a human into an environment which incentivizes stealing (for example) that group of humans will steal much more than humans who were put into different environment.	NoArgument	test
video games				This cannot be argued in this day and age mate.	NoArgument	test
video games				>There’s a difference between criminals forcing themselves on people and companies using dirty advertising.	NoArgument	test
video games				So to reiterate.	NoArgument	test
video games				As you don't agree with my example.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your stance is that it is perfectly okay for companies to knowingly do actions that hurt kids/parents/families?	NoArgument	test
video games				>You wouldn’t hand all your money to a kid and trust them in a toy store, would you?	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, the point is that today the same mistake can cost you/your parent a hellova lot more than it could ever before.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you have credit info, or a working mobile plan you can spend money for couple of hundred loot boxes with what, 7-8 clicks?	NoArgument	test
video games				The kid will do that for an hour or until they hit the limit and that can quite literally cost you a thousands of bucks if not more.	NoArgument	test
video games				What damage could kid do some 20 years ago with a credit card?	NoArgument	test
video games				It's the same problems, just the impact is much more visible.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's like having a live fire in your living room.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's absolutely okay, as long as you and your kids won't touch it.	NoArgument	test
video games				But it can kill or disfigure your kids if they do, but as long as you are watching over them it's fine right?	NoArgument	test
video games				No need to remove that huge hazard from your life.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Well I’m not a gambling addict, and neither is my wife.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah I know, if you were, you wouldn't be saying things like "You can learn from your mistakes" when it comes to addictive behavior.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Should we have safeguards in place because they can’t control their impulses?	NoArgument	test
video games				Should we not sell alcohol because alcoholics can’t control themselves?	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, we do.	NoArgument	test
video games				And yes people as a rule don't sell alcohol to alcoholics, altho that has to with safety.	NoArgument	test
video games				But yeah, we are already doing that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Through various kinds of methods we encourage or discourage certain behaviors.	NoArgument	test
video games				And sometimes even banning some.	NoArgument	test
video games				The things that are restricted the most are addictive substances.	NoArgument	test
video games				>not qualified to be answering these questions.	NoArgument	test
video games				You know US has regulations right?	NoArgument	test
video games				For example about online gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				>How often is this a problem though?	NoArgument	test
video games				A problem big enough the conserted groups of people are forcing their governmental representatives to push to regulate loot boxes in videogames (giving them mature rating) and/or classify loot boxes as gambling, and or disclosing odds of the loot boxes, and or banning loot boxes, etc...	NoArgument	test
video games				Now it is possible there is a global conspiracy and it's some kind of 4D chess thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I wouldn't count on it.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Unfortunately here, some mistakes will be made, but just as a parent should have learned some responsibility before having a kid, a kid needs to learn some responsibility in their social interactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not about responsibility.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's irrelevant.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you want to actually SOLVE the problem the question of responsibility simply plays no role.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even you decide that it's 100% the responsibility of the parent, the most effective / only way to remove that problem can still be to held the companies accountable.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mean it might let you feel fuzzy inside by deciding who's at fault, but that's about it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well you managed to twist and straw man everything I said.	NoArgument	test
video games				I’m not gonna repeat myself.	NoArgument	test
video games				You either comprehended what I said or you didn’t.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you are certainly repeating yourself so I don’t feel any obligation to address your new comments.	NoArgument	test
video games				Bottom line, parents should remove their credit card info from the game store/console if they can’t trust their kids with it.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is *not* that hard.	NoArgument	test
video games				While I agree with your notion, your example is just horrendous!	NoArgument	test
video games				It's actually people on your side blaming the companies for luring kids into gambling with their parent's money!	NoArgument	test
video games				(I think you're justified in that, but that example made me burst in laughter)	NoArgument	test
video games				No idea what you mean.	NoArgument	test
video games				Companies put out loot boxes because they work.	NoArgument	test
video games				They happen to work on kids, and kids happen to be a big consumer for them.	NoArgument	test
video games				You interpret that however you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				>"It's not the fault of the person for raping that girl, she shouldn't have been wearing those slutty clothes".	NoArgument	test
video games				Ot's not the fault of the kid for stealing..	NoArgument	test
video games				They shouldn't have used such a game mechanic.	NoArgument	test
video games				Who stole something?	NoArgument	test
video games				Kids when they take money off their parents' visa cards without permission.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hmm, oh right.	NoArgument	test
video games				Kids aren't considered adults in United States and don't have the same obligations and rights as adults.	NoArgument	test
video games				Adults are responsible for the kids actions.	NoArgument	test
video games				Barring some extremes (kid murdering something or holding a gun to your head) a kid cannot be charged for stealing their parents credit card.	NoArgument	test
video games				As it is legally as you stealing a credit card from yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Forgetting legality kid stealing something is seen as the failure of the parent.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thus in every way parents are at fault be it legally or morally in our society.	NoArgument	test
video games				At most you can say that it's the parents fault for kids stealing their credit card and using it to play games.	NoArgument	test
video games				In my example I was using an example of rapist (the companies that willingly earns money from kids paying for loot boxes) and the victim (the kids/parents being impacted by them).	NoArgument	test
video games				Oh I never said the kids should be held legally liable!	NoArgument	test
video games				And I do agree with everything you said..	NoArgument	test
video games				It's just the example seemed so ironic.	NoArgument	test
video games				Randomness alone doesn't create gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				While laws vary jurisdiction to jurisdiction, country to country, the general rule in most Western jurisdictions is that gambling is created by three separate elements; prize, chance, and consideration.	NoArgument	test
video games				All three elements must be present for a given proposition to be gambling, and breaking one of those three legs of the gambling triangle is sufficient to make a given proposition not be gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's look at each one in turn.	NoArgument	test
video games				Consideration is the easiest one to look at.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's lawyer-ese for "cost," "stakes," or "entry fee."  If participants have to put up money, then you have consideration.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they don't, then you don't.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lack of consideration is how the 'casino night' fundraiser put together by the local charity isn't gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah, people are playing craps and black jack...but the only money they are putting up is voluntary donations to the charity.	NoArgument	test
video games				They can still play the games even if they don't donate.	NoArgument	test
video games				Ergo, not gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is also why various pull-tab-like promotions contain a disclaimer that says "no purchase required for entry...to receive a free game piece, do blah-blah-blah."  They are making sure to avoid consideration.	NoArgument	test
video games				(plus a bunch of other stuff.  Sweepstakes law is seriously its own thing).	NoArgument	test
video games				Chance might seem equally easy to evaluate, but you might be surprised.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some jurisdictions break games into 'games of skill' vs.	NoArgument	test
video games				'games of chance.'  If the outcome of an event is controlled by the skill of the operator of that event, then it generally breaks this leg of the triangle.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is why professional sports, for instance, aren't gambling (distinct from gambling ON professional sports, mind you).	NoArgument	test
video games				There is a theory that poker would not be gambling if it were not specifically outlawed in many states, because of the skill-testing nature of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Other jurisdictions (I think the Canadian Supreme Court, for instance) also include a category of 'mixed games of skill and chance,' which in my opinion would actually cover almost all of them if we were to be honest.	NoArgument	test
video games				However much skill might be involved in football, the bounce of a fumbled ball is entirely random.	NoArgument	test
video games				Conversely, the cast of two dice is entirely a function of chance, but knowing which bets on the craps felt are safer and which ones are sucker bets is what separates losers from.....smaller losers, I guess.	NoArgument	test
video games				Given that the house always wins over enough time.	NoArgument	test
video games				Determining what is chance and what is not is likely to generate a rousing debate.	NoArgument	test
video games				Prize is another one that might seem simple, but is at the heart of loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				What constitutes a prize?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well....a prize has to have value.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it does not have value, then it's not a prize.	NoArgument	test
video games				You and I can play roulette all day long, but if the only thing we can get is scraps of colored paper, we are not gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is how Monopoly isn't illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				So what makes a thing have value?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well, if it's cash, that's easy.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cash has value.	NoArgument	test
video games				But what if it's not cash, but it's something you could turn into cash?	NoArgument	test
video games				Like....I dunno....a Faberge egg or a new car or something.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's obviously also a prize.	NoArgument	test
video games				The law recognizes this property called 'fair market value' to determine if something is a prize.	NoArgument	test
video games				But it sorta weasels around it by not setting a specific limit.	NoArgument	test
video games				Something is a 'prize' if it has a 'more than nominal' fair market value.	NoArgument	test
video games				A new car or a Faberge egg....clearly a prize.	NoArgument	test
video games				A Bic ball point pen, not really a prize, as it has only a nominal value.	NoArgument	test
video games				Where do you draw the line?	NoArgument	test
video games				The answer is kinda scary.	NoArgument	test
video games				A District Attorney, Crown Prosecutor, or some other version of The Man just decides what it is, and either arrests your or not depending on their determination.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your recourse is a high paid lawyer to argue the other side.	NoArgument	test
video games				And THIS is the crux of loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the thing you can get out of loot box does \_NOT\_ have an above-nominal fair market value, then by definition it is \_NOT\_ gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes that just contain things you play a game with....and which \_CANNOT\_ be exchanged for cash in any scenario....are almost definitionally not prizes.	NoArgument	test
video games				N.B., this is how Valve has gotten themselves into trouble with Counterstrike.	NoArgument	test
video games				People were selling skins for real money on 3rd party websites.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some DAs figured this put them far enough into the territory of 'prizes' of 'more than nominal value.'  Valve was counting on the fact that the websites were not actually Valve websites to protect, but the fact that they exposed the skins through an API that the 3P websites used sorta exposed that as the insufficient fig-leaf defense that it is.	NoArgument	test
video games				So...could a lootbox contain a thing of real world value, and thus be gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				Sure.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it contained a token you redeem for $1000, no question.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if all it contains is a funny hat that your avatar can wear, it's simply not a prize as far as the law is concerned.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				>is the addictive nature of gambling taken into account in determining if something is gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				Not so far as I've ever encountered, though like I said....laws really vary by jurisdiction.	NoArgument	test
video games				In the US, most of the relevant laws are state laws, and some of them are quite old.	NoArgument	test
video games				Like....late 1800s old.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's sketchy to say, at best, that the ingame items that can be received from lootboxes have no value.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even in games where trading items is banned, accounts are sold (which in of itself isn't illegal, just agains the TOS), which have different values depending on the types of ingame items they have.	NoArgument	test
video games				The main argument for why ingame items have no value is because the developers of the games in question claim they do not.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the producer and/or distributor of a product does not generally have authority on what the market value of their products are.	NoArgument	test
video games				They set the price, but only in their transactions and that price is based on what people will be willing to pay for it.	NoArgument	test
video games				As long as people are willing to buy or trade for ingame items, and as long as people are willing to buy accounts and their value varies depending on ingame items tied to the account, you can make the case that ingame items have monetary value.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah but there's always the argument that, as long as they aren't supporting or enabling the selling of the accounts, it really isn't on the game developers and they can't be held accountable for it.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is why Valve got in trouble, they were essentially enabling third party selling of skins through their exposed API which is why they had to send cease and decist letters to many websites using their API, to cover themselves from that and show they weren't enabling it.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is a good point, it's why I specifically mentioned in my long post that the determination of what fair market value is, and whether it is more than nominal, is a determination simply made by a DA, SA, or CP.	NoArgument	test
video games				The real bottom line is that 'random purchase' has been around at least since the advent of baseball cards in their modern form, which is something like 100 years or so.	NoArgument	test
video games				And almost no official prosecutor has taken the matter up.	NoArgument	test
video games				There has been sniffing around from time to time (some of which I have personally been involved with), but almost no action has been taken.	NoArgument	test
video games				Really...that speaks volumes to the question of legality.	NoArgument	test
video games				As to the issue of selling accounts, which of course happens, that gets into a different question entirely.	NoArgument	test
video games				That is: what is going on when you "buy" software?	NoArgument	test
video games				As you probably know, you're not actually buying it.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're paying for a license.	NoArgument	test
video games				And the terms of that license for a game are spelled out in the ToS or other such document, as you say.	NoArgument	test
video games				Every ToS I'm aware of forbids the selling of accounts.	NoArgument	test
video games				So to the extent that there is an unregulated and unlicensed 'grey' market, that's hardly on the publisher.	NoArgument	test
video games				If anyone is going to get into trouble in this situation, it's going to be the participants in the grey market, UNLESS the publisher is actually aiding in the formation of the market....which is how Valve got busted.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s so absurd to me people consider poker gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can gamble within poker, but some people can make quantifiably consistent returns over time.	NoArgument	test
video games				You’ll never meet a professional roulette player, but there are plenty of professional poker players.	NoArgument	test
video games				The idea of 'mixed game of skill and chance,' which iirc is terminology that came out of Canada's supreme court, has always been the most interesting to me.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm pretty convinced that the vast majority of games are mixed games of skill and chance, the exceptions I can think of being chess, checkers, go, and similar games (shogi, hnefatafl).	NoArgument	test
video games				Having watched and enjoyed Rounders, and having a good number of friends and acquaintances who are serious poker players, I'm familiar with the arguments.	NoArgument	test
video games				Whether or not poker is a game of chance depends, I think, on what one considers to be the parameters of a game of poker.	NoArgument	test
video games				Is it one hand?	NoArgument	test
video games				If so, it's pretty clearly a game of chance.	NoArgument	test
video games				The biggest savant at memorizing every odds table and recalling every card played and folded that hand still can only make an educated guess as to whether or not they will win a given hand.	NoArgument	test
video games				The term 'bad beat' exists for a reason after all.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or is a game of poker only measured over one evening of play?	NoArgument	test
video games				Or perhaps one tournament?	NoArgument	test
video games				There's still very much a chance element.	NoArgument	test
video games				Seriously successful professional poker players have 'down days' and even 'down weeks' where their income is negative.	NoArgument	test
video games				I read an article by some mathematician and poker fan one time who argued that, given the current size of the WSOP main event, whoever wins will have gone all-in on a long odds hand an average of three times!	NoArgument	test
video games				That's amazing luck, even if you are playing 100% correctly.	NoArgument	test
video games				Probably also why we haven't seen a repeat winner of the main (US) event since...what....the 1980s?	NoArgument	test
video games				It just doesn't happen anymore.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think only when you look at something like lifetime achievement, or at best achievement over a stretch of time measured in months or years, that the skill element is a clearly stronger signal than the luck element.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, I think it’s lazy to call it gambling simply because of what you are saying - it’s really about your average income over time.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you are skilled, you will recognize you may lose a few nights, but generally you will win more than you lose because your skill impact is much stronger.	NoArgument	test
video games				It certainly isn’t a game that can be taken in isolation, but when people say it’s gambling it makes no sense they wouldn’t apply the same definition to literally everything else in life.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can get unlucky driving one day and that is gambling your life, but we don’t consider driving gambling because the odds are so disproportionately lower than a 50-50 chance.	NoArgument	test
video games				> it makes no sense they wouldn’t apply the same definition to literally everything else in life.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, I agree with this.	NoArgument	test
video games				Almost everything is some mix of skill and luck.	NoArgument	test
video games				The hard questions are how much of each, and what sorts of regulations should exist because of this reality.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're not wrong, but you're just discussing the legal matters.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lootboxes still costs money, and it's addictive for the exact same reason.	NoArgument	test
video games				The fact that you can't get money back from it only makes it worse really.	NoArgument	test
video games				Getting money back would always make the problem worse if your concern is addiction, because it leads to people chasing losses.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is one the most critical parts of gambling fallacy and addiction - the perception that that if you just keep gambling, you’ll get back what you lost eventually and maybe even come out ahead.	NoArgument	test
video games				You straight up can’t chase losses with loot boxes if you can’t redeem the loot for anything.	NoArgument	test
video games				This stuff still has value for the people buying it.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's still similar tactics to get people to pay stuff.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even worse, it's gambling tactics being unleashed on people who aren't even allowed to gamble.	NoArgument	test
video games				The argument of whether it is immoral and a predatory marketing tactic is separate from whether it should be considered "gambling."  It can be predatory and immoral for companies to market like this without being considered gambling, especially for legal reasons.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's immoral.	NoArgument	test
video games				Especially towards kid's who don't know what they're doing and spending they're parents money.	NoArgument	test
video games				They just think it's part of the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Agreed, but that doesn't automatically classify it as gambling specifically	NoArgument	test
video games				> especially for legal reasons.	NoArgument	test
video games				What we're dealing with is that it's basically a loophole where it's technically not gambling but it has incredibly similar systems and triggers the same part of the brain.	NoArgument	test
video games				I really see it as a legal loophole to get kids to be gambling addicts.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then we need to classify it as it’s own thing and outlaw that, it’s a loophole cause it’s not the same in most cases.	NoArgument	test
video games				In some it might be actual gambling but the majority I don’t think you can actually say it is	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the entire argument of the original post comes from "should we consider it to be gambling", and I agree with that.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are definitely some good examples though, cs:go definitely had issues, but overwatch I think is a great example of loot boxes done right, you get a free lootbox that doesn’t require a key or anything every time you level up, which is somewhat frequently, that give you cosmetic skins and voice lines and stuff, but you can also buy more of them with money if you want to, but they’re the same exact ones you’d get if you just played the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				It’s a really good system that I think adds a lot to the game, and gives the developers a lot of support to continue working on the game	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't think it'd be better if you could just buy specific items for a specific amount of money?	NoArgument	test
video games				> You're not wrong, but you're just discussing the legal matters.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling...and specifically restriction of gambling which OP was specifically proposing...is a legal concept.	NoArgument	test
video games				Of course I'm talking about the legal matters.	NoArgument	test
video games				The legal matters is primarily what there is to talk about.	NoArgument	test
video games				> The legal matters is primarily what there is to talk about.	NoArgument	test
video games				I disagree, as I really see the lootbox practices as a legal loophole to be able to get kids to be gambling addicts.	NoArgument	test
video games				It works with very similar systems, triggers same parts of the brain, exploits money.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mean...I can understand your viewpoint.	NoArgument	test
video games				And I think if you want to make an argument that even if loot boxes aren't gambling, they should be regulated, then I'd be empathetic to your point of view, although I probably would not agree.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I took OP's statement that "loot boxes should be banned" to mean "should be illegal under current law."  In which case, you really have to try to understand what current law is.	NoArgument	test
video games				As far as the mechanisms of addiction go....I'm not an expert, but I've read some.	NoArgument	test
video games				My understanding is that opinions are divided on whether addiction is a physical or psychological thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				And in any event, outlawing something that some people enjoy but other people become addicted to...whatever exactly addiction is...hasn't really worked out so well for society in the past IMO.	NoArgument	test
video games				> I mean...I can understand your viewpoint.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well, that's enough for me really.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've been addicted to things that, even though they weren't exactly hurting how much I "functioned", still took up time I would've preferred to spend differently.	NoArgument	test
video games				My point is really that even when certain things might not get you to the point where you start skipping/being too late for work, sleep, social events, whatever, they might still not that good for you in a way.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've seen it being dismissed as "just fun" way too often and it bothers me.	NoArgument	test
video games				...so I'm glad you kinda get the point.	NoArgument	test
video games				> My understanding is that opinions are divided on whether addiction is a physical or psychological thing.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm no expert on the matter but...	NoArgument	test
video games				Both are perfectly possible, I do think that, generally speaking, it sorta comes down to the same kind of satisfactory "kick" you get.	NoArgument	test
video games				You might get this satisfactory kick (like a chemical in your brain) when you get some kind of reward like getting an item in a videogame or just someone telling you "well done" or tasting sugar...	NoArgument	test
video games				Your brain does really want to have this kind of kick, you really keep going for it.	NoArgument	test
video games				You'll get psychologically addicted when you're used to constantly having this satisfactory kick and you want to keep up that consistent "high".	NoArgument	test
video games				What a lot of drugs do is really opening up the gates for these chemical processes so you'll feel amazing, but it also leaves your brain sort of drained of it, so you'll feel awful a bit later because it's lacking something when your brain replaces that satisfactory chemical in your head.	NoArgument	test
video games				Use drugs again and it opens up those gates again.	NoArgument	test
video games				Do it consistently and you'll end up needing to "open up the gates" to feel somewhat normal.	NoArgument	test
video games				So that's basically physical dependency.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's also stuff (I think this already happens with alcohol and smoking) where your body after finally stopping to consuming those things feels like it needs to become clean and that whole process feels incredibly awful.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's also still the case that these are not mutually exclusive.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think caffeine speaks to the typical reward system but to you feeling energized through something else, but that's still a feeling you want to keep up.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, I'm no expert on it.	NoArgument	test
video games				I just know it sorta kinda works like that.	NoArgument	test
video games				While I tend to agree that spending _real_ money on said lootboxes needs regulation (though I don't know if I would go so far as making it illegal) I stop short of this part:  >You put in either **video game currency** or real currency and something random pops up as a reward.	NoArgument	test
video games				Using in-game currency shouldn't be an issue for lootboxes, providing that there is no way to purchase in-game currency with real world currency.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most games have internal drop mechanics where any given enemy or task has a X% chance of providing a certain item or benefit to the player.	NoArgument	test
video games				This has been a core mechanic of games - video and tabletop - for decades and isn't inherently problematic.	NoArgument	test
video games				Having that mechanic activate when you kill an enemy or finish a turn, rather than when you use your in-game currency to purchase an item is distinction without difference to me - your in-game actions allow you to activate this mechanic.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's actually not the same.	NoArgument	test
video games				Games usually have enemies that have a certain chance of dropping a specific item.	NoArgument	test
video games				So you can choose to farm those enemies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lootboxes, could be the same, if they were categorized into "weapon lootbox", "armor lootbox" and so on.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they are not.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most lootboxes drop weapons and armor and cosmetics at the same time.	NoArgument	test
video games				So inputing any kind of currency, be it virtual or real money, at the very least, feels unsatisfying.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even if there are no official methods for purchasing in game currency, most MMOs have underground economies where you can get in game currency from people who farm for it or hack it in.	NoArgument	test
video games				RuneScape has no direct gold purchase, but anyone who has played has heard "selling gold 1m per USD, cheap rates, legit no scam!	NoArgument	test
video games				www dot shadywebsite dot com" games with in game currency loot boxes can still be dangerous for people with gambling addiction.	NoArgument	test
video games				True, but having to go track down a website and purchase the currency through back channels isn't something that you can really hold against the game developers, as it is not a feature they wanted to have in their game at all (many even ban accounts for this behavior).	NoArgument	test
video games				As long as you have persistent multi-player games, you will have people who game the system for cash outside of the rules.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes for any in game currency that can be purchased with cash (through legitimate channels or not.) are gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a developer makes a game that allows for gambling, even if it is at their own expense through shady third part dealers, that design choice is certainly something I feel justified in holding against them.	NoArgument	test
video games				If people were willing to buy Chuck E Cheese reward tickets from you at a dollar per ticket, that franchise would be similar to a casino in that there would be a real value to their games, even if the catalyst (a profitable secondary market for tokens and tickets) was not part of their plan.	NoArgument	test
video games				The franchise Cracking down on the secondary market would reduce or eliminate the gambling aspect, but turning a blind eye to the issue would make them complicit.	NoArgument	test
video games				I disagree and I'm curious where you draw the line.	NoArgument	test
video games				Spend gold, get lootbox, open lootbox for chance of loot:  This is what you say should be banned     What about spend gold, get gear needed to raid, kill raid boss, loot boss for chance of loot?	NoArgument	test
video games				Thats pretty much core MMO gameplay.	NoArgument	test
video games				What if instead of spending gold on gear, zoning in to the raid took some consumable item you had to buy with gold?	NoArgument	test
video games				And maybe the first boss is so trivial it's essentially just a free loot pinata?	NoArgument	test
video games				Cause now that just sounds like ingame currency lootboxes with extra steps.	NoArgument	test
video games				Or for a more direct real world analogy, in WoW at one time you could craft things and have a random chance to craft an extra.	NoArgument	test
video games				The 'things' were all digital, as were the currency, but would you consider this gambling since someone out there could be buying gold with real money on a third party site and using that gold for crafting mats?	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes mean that you have a chance of spending real world value on something you don't know the value of until you open it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Technically Pokemon cards fit the definition I've given, so I'm not 100% sure that it is a definitive answer.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's definitely somewhere with lots of grey area so it's fun to explore..	NoArgument	test
video games				personally I think Pokemon cards are more like gambling than loot boxes, yet I also am more opposed to lootboxes precisely because of their lack of real world value( so no legit resell and at any time the items can be revoked or otherwise have their intrinsic value modified)	NoArgument	test
video games				It's hard to pin down specifically when video game monitization crosses that line.	NoArgument	test
video games				I would say that 3 or more items from the following list indicates cause for concern.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are there any items you would add to the list?	NoArgument	test
video games				(Or ones that you would remove?)  Non-cosmetic microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				Microtransactions in a full price game.	NoArgument	test
video games				Microtransactions that give a pvp advantage.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes tied to microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				(Gambling, by my definition.)  Excessive grind.	NoArgument	test
video games				Game progression that can be greatly accelerated with the use of microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				More than 25% of the content at release is in Day One DLC or On Disc DLC.	NoArgument	test
video games				Day One DLC or On Disc DLC costs more than 10$.	NoArgument	test
video games				Items can be traded between player accounts using currency that can be purchased for real money.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Items can be traded between player accounts using currency that can be purchased for real money.	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel like this can be offset by allowing that same currency to be grinded.	NoArgument	test
video games				While I generally also dislike "pay to not grind to win" style games, for some reason I don't mind how eve and some other MMOs do it where if you play and grind enough you can avoid the subscription cost through in game trading.	NoArgument	test
video games				Otherwise I agree with the  list	NoArgument	test
video games				I feel like trading is one of the less offensive items on the list, but when combined with others it can be exploitative.	NoArgument	test
video games				Per example: Dragonball Legends.	NoArgument	test
video games				A mobile phone game that's free to play.	NoArgument	test
video games				Except it has in game purchases to further sell itself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Similar to Marvel: Contest of Champions.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can buy in game currency to use on loot box to get something that you may want, such as a new character.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Most will probably agree with me that loot crates or boxes have ruined video games or so called "free gaming apps."  I'll challenge this point then.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot boxes allow for companies to have a continuing revenue stream long after the games release, which increases the amount of support the game gets.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, *Rainbow 6 Siege* is a game I play regularly.	NoArgument	test
video games				It was released in December 2015 and still receives free content updates to this day because the cosmetic only lootboxes keep it profitable for the publisher.	NoArgument	test
video games				Additionally, some games only achieve a critical mass of players because they are free, sustained by loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				*Apex Legends* is wholly free, not even requiring a console online subscription to play.	NoArgument	test
video games				This has let me play with some of my friends who otherwise would never have taken their system online.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Loot boxes allow for companies to have a continuing revenue stream long after the games release, which increases the amount of support the game gets.	NoArgument	test
video games				More support isn't always good.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a game dev knows they can still continue work to fix the game long after release, they have less incentive to provide customers with a complete, bug-free game at release.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hey will take their time fixing bugs and adding promised features.	NoArgument	test
video games				I could give countless examples where this happens.	NoArgument	test
video games				No need to playtest a game before you release it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just let the customers find the bugs and you can fix them later.	NoArgument	test
video games				And there's no incentive to fix the bugs quickly for the average player, because these games cater to whales and whales only.	NoArgument	test
video games				Because hu might get 10-20 bucks from an average player, but 80% of their income comes from the top 20% of players, who blow thousands of dollars on the game to get ahead.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a whale has a problem with a bug, they will fix it in an hour.	NoArgument	test
video games				If an average game has a bug, they'll get to it when they can  which could be never.	NoArgument	test
video games				Because they don't care about rh average gamer, and they have no incentive to careeither, so who can blame them?	NoArgument	test
video games				Meanwhile, you have Minecradt, a take that is what, over 10 years old, and they still constantly release updates to the game improving features and adding new completely free content with no lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				The difference is they strive to make a good and fun game, and they succeeded, rather than focusing on making money from the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the game is good, the money will come, its plain and simple.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you spend all your time thinking ajoiut how many different ways can I charge people to play my game, you spend less time making the game, and your gameplay suffers for it.	NoArgument	test
video games				And the beauty or James without lootboxes is that everyone pays the exact same price for the exact same game.	NoArgument	test
video games				The free, each and every player is an equally valuable customer, and they will listen to everyone equally.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your 1st example is factually incorrect.	NoArgument	test
video games				You cannot even buy alpha packs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Setting aside that you can buy boosters and the season pass in order to acquire renown faster (the latter even increases your drop %), Siege has had several temporary lootbox events that were cash only.	NoArgument	test
video games				Outbreak was the first one, then they had ones for summer, and the April Fools event off the top of my head.	NoArgument	test
video games				You cannot buy alpha packs, you can buy the limited time event packs which are capped at like \~20 dollars.	NoArgument	test
video games				To say that event packs are the 'profit' drivers is silly.	NoArgument	test
video games				No-one I know in rb6 (20 or so people) buys them vs year passes or specific operators (like 80-90% of the people I know have bought those 2).	NoArgument	test
video games				&#x200B;  Rb6 is a perfect example of a game that generates profit without lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't have to lie to try to get a delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				>You cannot buy alpha packs, you can buy the limited time event packs which are capped at like \~20 dollars.	NoArgument	test
video games				To say that event packs are the 'profit' drivers is silly.	NoArgument	test
video games				No-one I know in rb6 (20 or so people) buys them vs year passes or specific operators (like 80-90% of the people I know have bought those 2).	NoArgument	test
video games				You've shifted from arguing that I'm factually incorrect to saying that *you* don't know anyone that buys them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Most people don't, lootbox revenues are generally driven by "whales." That said, Siege sells a lot of stuff, from the renown boosters to the season pass to the cash only cosmetics like elite uniforms.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cash loot boxes comprise a chunk of that revenue, sufficient that Ubisoft has continued to do it several times.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Rb6 is a perfect example of a game that generates profit without lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				You don't have to lie to try to get a delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				And you don't have to get defensive when you misinterpret a comment.	NoArgument	test
video games				No, you are factually incorrect on multiple points.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cosmetics packs in rb6 are not driven by whales because you are capped on the amt of lootboxes you can buy.	NoArgument	test
video games				You acted like you could always buy lootboxes in your oc, when you can't, they've been available to buy like \~3 times.	NoArgument	test
video games				&#x200B;  Once again, you don't have to lie in an attempt to get a delta.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why bother responding to my post if you aren't going to read it?	NoArgument	test
video games				You completely misrepresented both rb6's monetization model & how the lootboxes work.	NoArgument	test
video games				Firstly, you implied that lootboxes are what make rb6 profitable and allow for development, a false statement.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly, you called the revenue that ubisoft receives, 'continous' which is a blatant lie as even by your own statement, the paid lootboxes (which are not alpha packs) are rarely available.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly, you tried to say that rb6 paid lootboxes allow for 'whaling'.	NoArgument	test
video games				An extremely blatant lie as you can only buy a set amount of the lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				I ignored all your parts about non lootbox monetization as I was being generous to you and didn't feel like pointing out that it directly contradicts your prior arguements.	NoArgument	test
video games				Let's not forget Star Wars: Battlefront which was so broken that loot boxes and downloadable content ruined the experience.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yep, and this is an extreme example.	NoArgument	test
video games				Also, they fixed it.	NoArgument	test
video games				That may be true, but big video games such as Mortal Kombat or Call of Duty, don't need loot boxes to survive.	NoArgument	test
video games				They're just companies being greedy trying to cheat more money out of a game that already was 60$ or more to play in the first place.	NoArgument	test
video games				>That may be true, but big video games such as Mortal Kombat or Call of Duty, don't need loot boxes to survive.	NoArgument	test
video games				No, they just release sequels.	NoArgument	test
video games				I mentioned Siege, which was released in 2015, only a few months after Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Mortal Kombat X.	NoArgument	test
video games				Call of Duty has since released three sequels with a fourth on the way, and support has all but ended for those prior titles.	NoArgument	test
video games				Mortal Kombat is not as frequent but is on the same trajectory.	NoArgument	test
video games				Dota 2 may not have become the juggernaut it is without loot boxes to support it.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's entirely free with all characters unlocked, supported entirely by cosmetics.	NoArgument	test
video games				This means they can be more outgoing with their character designs, since everyone had access to all viable counter picks.	NoArgument	test
video games				Compare this to LoL which sells characters.	NoArgument	test
video games				Their character designs are lot more homogenised.	NoArgument	test
video games				It allows them to make the game F2P, getting huge penetration into poorer markets.	NoArgument	test
video games				It allows them to continue releasing updates after new players stop buying the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				They don't have to release Dota 3 and Dota 4 to keep profiting off the franchise.	NoArgument	test
video games				They can just continue to add to the one product.	NoArgument	test
video games				Mortal Kombat doesn't really have lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				For the record.	NoArgument	test
video games				It has random treasure chests which you don't know what your getting when you open them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just as bad.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah but you can't buy the treasure chests with money?	NoArgument	test
video games				You can only buy chests with koins which you can ONLY get from playing the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				If a random chest with a random item is a loot box then that means pretty much every RPG with a loot system has lootboxes by your definition.	NoArgument	test
video games				The key difference is paying for them with REAL money.	NoArgument	test
video games				There is ZERO way to purchase chests in MK with REAL money.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Loot crates in video games is gambling  No argument there.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's pretty much what it is.	NoArgument	test
video games				> ...and should be banned  Gambling shouldn't be illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is your money, and you get to decide what to do with it.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not my business to tell you that I don't think you're making good choices.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have the right to just not partake in this gambling, therefore it's none of my concern if you do.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling can be a problem for games designed for children.	NoArgument	test
video games				At the very least this revenue stream should be regulated like any another lottery.	NoArgument	test
video games				I completely agree that it should be treated like gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm saying that gambling shouldn't be illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				What about games that specifically target a minor demographic?	NoArgument	test
video games				Don't care.	NoArgument	test
video games				As long as no one is being forced into anything, they can target whomever they want.	NoArgument	test
video games				Cereal commercials specifically try and convince my kid that Lucky Charms are the most delicious thing ever.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's my job to not buy them for him if I don't want him to have them.	NoArgument	test
video games				How do you feel about drugs?	NoArgument	test
video games				Should you be allowed to give addictive drugs to a child?	NoArgument	test
video games				Slow down, you're skipping a step in there, namely the part about the parents.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your parents should be able to take you to a casino if they want to, to buy a lottery ticket with you, and to let to play games with loot boxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				And they should be able to STOP you from doing those things, too.	NoArgument	test
video games				Adderall/Ritalin?	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot crates aren't gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look boxes are a variable reward item, but there always is a reward.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it was gambling then you would have a chance to get nothing back at all.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are packs of baseball cards gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				In addition to what scottevil110 said, from a practical point of view many awards in the boxes may as well be nothing.	NoArgument	test
video games				Eg a loot box filled with skins for characters you don't play, but there's that one Ultra rare skin you do want  You risk getting garbage you will never use and can't resell (eg nothing) for the once you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree with everything you said, and I don't find it in conflict with my view.	NoArgument	test
video games				As I said, it is a variable reward, but you don't walk away empty handed.	NoArgument	test
video games				Neither you or Scott addressed my question though.	NoArgument	test
video games				Are packs of baseball cards gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				What's the value of the minimum payout compared to the cost of playing?	NoArgument	test
video games				If you play a $10 slot machine, and you're guaranteed to win at least 1 cent, I think most would still consider that gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				We aren't talking about items with direct money value, and we aren't talking about items that have the same value to everyone.	NoArgument	test
video games				A more accurate example would be if the minimum payout was a small sticker that most people don't care about.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe the sticker says "I gambled" or something.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then you might get tourist who decide to use the slot machine once just to get the sticker as a souvenir.	NoArgument	test
video games				Did they gamble?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think we're approaching pedantic at this point.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you wager money (or something of value) on something, with the hope of obtaining a desired result, then yes, that is a gamble.	NoArgument	test
video games				The chance does not have to exist for you to lose EVERYTHING for it to still clearly be betting on something.	NoArgument	test
video games				The whole "buying a sticker" thing is how places have had to get around the dumbass gambling laws in several states, by claiming that you're actually buying a sticker.	NoArgument	test
video games				It just might come with $1,000 attached to it, oh and the sticker costs $20.	NoArgument	test
video games				How about instead of playing the loophole game, we just act like adults and say "Yeah, it's gambling, and you can do it if you want to."	NoArgument	test
video games				How about my original question, are packs of baseball cards gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				Depends on who you are, I suppose, and what your goal in buying baseball cards is.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you just like getting the cards, then no, you're just buying baseball cards.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you're specifically searching for one card that exists somewhere in one of those packs, and you consider anything else failure, then yes, I suppose every pack you buy is a gamble.	NoArgument	test
video games				Which is exactly why you shouldn't be in the business of telling people what they can and can't do with regard to gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				So you seem to define gambling in relative terms, which legally is quite an issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				Such a view can be contorted to make anything gambling and to make nothing gambling depending on the individuals goals.	NoArgument	test
video games				In short, it is a useless definition.	NoArgument	test
video games				> So you seem to define gambling in relative terms, which legally is quite an issue.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not if you just keep the law out of it, then it becomes a complete non-issue because you can just make your own decisions, like an adult.	NoArgument	test
video games				> In short, it is a useless definition.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's only a useless definition if you're still bent on meddling in people's affairs and telling them what YOU think is a good use of THEIR money.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, if you just leave them alone, then it's a complete non-issue, because who cares whether you consider it gambling or not?	NoArgument	test
video games				They wanna buy some baseball cards, then they buy some baseball cards.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's none of your business.	NoArgument	test
video games				If it's against US law or state law, it shouldn't be allowed or better monitored.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, my argument is that it shouldn't be against state law or US law.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is none of the law's business what you do with your own money.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's the point of it being yours.	NoArgument	test
video games				You cannot make the case that gambling is hurting anyone against their will or taking anything from anyone who didn't willingly engage.	NoArgument	test
video games				Therefore, it's none of your business.	NoArgument	test
video games				>Gambling is illegal in most states and illegal under US law.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling is [not broadly illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_in_the_United_States#Authorized_types) in the way you imply.	NoArgument	test
video games				It is regulated, and various types of gambling are illegal (or not) on a state-by-state basis.	NoArgument	test
video games				Only two states have legal, state-wide casino gambling, but most states have at least some form of legal gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Utah and Hawaii are the only two states where gambling is illegal even for charitable events.	NoArgument	test
video games				South Carolina and Tennessee make most forms of gambling illegal except for the lottery rackets run by the states themselves.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree with you that loot boxes are a problem, but a total ban probably goes a bit too far.	NoArgument	test
video games				There should probably be an attempt to require games that have loot boxes require age verification and pay tough fines for selling them to minors.	NoArgument	test
video games				The cost of this system would likely make most studios abandon this method of profit generation by default.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				If they're shown to be harmful enough to survive a challenge in court, sure.	NoArgument	test
video games				So far all the lawsuits against these products attempting to define them as unregulated gambling have failed.	NoArgument	test
video games				The main difference I see between card packs/mystery figurines and loot boxes is that even if the companies producing them shut down you still have a physical object that has an intrinsic value as a piece of art or a collectible toy or a game piece that persists regardless of the status of the company who produced it.	NoArgument	test
video games				But once a game shuts down the loot box contents disappear into the ether, never to be used or seen again.	NoArgument	test
video games				[deleted]	NoArgument	test
video games				>Isn’t that more of an issue with selling physical vs digital goods and not at all an issue of gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's undeniable that baseball cards and Pokemon cards and similar products are a form of gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				The question is the level of harm to society and how much regulation should occur, just as I pointed out in my first post.	NoArgument	test
video games				So far, Pokemon and Magic have gotten away with the "but our cards have value in and of themselves" defense, but that might not last forever depending on whether any harm is done.	NoArgument	test
video games				The fact of the matter is that physical items are more difficult to put your parents into debt over.	NoArgument	test
video games				If card packs or mystery figurines are being purchased at Target it's usually mom or dad buying them, so there's a level of control that's more difficult to manage over an online game that has transactions that are essentially unregulated, since there are few (if any) repercussions for game companies who do not comply with the sparse regulation that already exists.	NoArgument	test
video games				When I was a kid the big problem was 900 numbers.	NoArgument	test
video games				I never got hooked on any because I was already dialing BBSes and reading gopher sites via a dialup connection to the internet, but lots of kids dialed 900 numbers and put their families into serious financial trouble.	NoArgument	test
video games				Eventually almost everyone knew a family where a kid had spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on premium phone calls.	NoArgument	test
video games				Finally the FTC put their foot down, not by banning 1-900 numbers but strongly regulating how they worked, requiring informational disclaimers during calls, the ability to just outright block 900 numbers from being dialed through your telephone service, and prohibiting certain methods of debt collection for 900 number debts.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, these are regulations that manage some of the nastier abuses of a business without outright banning it and still leaving room for adults to wreck their own lives.	NoArgument	test
video games				I forsee the game industry having a similar regulatory moment as the 900 people.	NoArgument	test
video games				Honestly, the biggest issue with banning loot crates is defining what a loot crate is and only banning the behavior you actually want to ban.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, is any game that you can spend money on stuff that has random drops a loot-box?	NoArgument	test
video games				Most Games/apps are widely played around the world.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no reason to enforce US standards on Gambling worldwide.	NoArgument	test
video games				Therefore they should only be banned where local law prohibits gambling, but should be kept in the game for the jurisdictions that allow it.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't mind if people want to pay for using apps, though I do mind when you pay for something, you should get what you want, not something you don't want.	NoArgument	test
video games				So it seems like your view is composed of two premises:  1.	NoArgument	test
video games				Loot crates are gambling  2.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling should be banned from video games  Relevant to the second premise, do you oppose online poker games that use real money?	NoArgument	test
video games				Nope.	NoArgument	test
video games				People know that's gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Where as, they might not realize if it's a loot box.	NoArgument	test
video games				It should state that to customers.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just like fantasy football websites like Draft Kings do.	NoArgument	test
video games				So then you don't fully believe gambling should be banned from video games?	NoArgument	test
video games				Only if it's breaking state or US law.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the game has a license to do that then, yes.	NoArgument	test
video games				If not, then no.	NoArgument	test
video games				That seems significantly different from your OP in which you said all gambling should be banned from video games, unless I am misunderstanding something.	NoArgument	test
video games				So delete this thread and remake it with a title that's actually reflecting this argument	NoArgument	test
video games				Many purchases could be seen as gambling by your example, I’m in a town I don’t know, I enter a restaurant.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are prices on a menu but I have no idea if I’ll get food food or food sickness.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some games are free and others are paid for.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are many games of chance that do not get called gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Carnival games offer prizes, often junk, and are not shut down as gambling,	NoArgument	test
video games				all your examples aren’t considered gambling?	NoArgument	test
video games				at a restaurant you order exactly what you want.	NoArgument	test
video games				The options typically have ingredients listed so you know what you’re getting.	NoArgument	test
video games				bad food is bound to happen but it isn’t just blindly giving money to a restaurant and hoping good food comes out.	NoArgument	test
video games				At carnivals the games are typically more test your skill.	NoArgument	test
video games				like the hit the bell, shoot a basketball, or toss a ring.	NoArgument	test
video games				and the fact you know how well you have to preform beforehand to obtain certain prizes.	NoArgument	test
video games				makes it less like gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				online loot boxes are straight up put in money and hope you get lucky drops.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yeah, even more so when it's a crate it shakes it up, opens, you don't know what your going to get as result.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's basically a slot machine, hoping to get lucky.	NoArgument	test
video games				Can you win something IRL or just in game?	NoArgument	test
video games				As long as everything is in-game, it's fine to have random outcomes.	NoArgument	test
video games				DnD, Backgammon, and numerous other games are based on die rolling, which is random.	NoArgument	test
video games				The difference between Parchissi and Craps is that Parchissi there is no real money on the line, whereas Craps there is (usually).	NoArgument	test
video games				That is why Craps is considered gambling and Parchissi isn't.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if you put real money on Parchissi, and use Monopoly money for Craps, the reverse would be true.	NoArgument	test
video games				So too with loot crates.	NoArgument	test
video games				Monsters have been dropping random items since video games began.	NoArgument	test
video games				Farming certain monsters for certain low probability drops is as old as gaming.	NoArgument	test
video games				What's new is the option to spend real money for extra spins/chances.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's the infusion of real cash, which makes it gambling.	NoArgument	test

video games				Why should gambling be illegal?	NoArgument	test
video games				At least for minor and there are a lot of kids who takes their parents card for loot box	NoArgument	test
video games				That's already illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why should it be double illegal?	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling, like smoking and drinking, is addictive and harmful in excess, so it should be regulated.	NoArgument	test
video games				Besides the fact that that is entirely different from banning anything, why?	NoArgument	test
video games				Well, regulated means that in some cases: minors, some locations, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				it is illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				Smoking in an airplane is illegal.	NoArgument	test
video games				No one said gambling should be illegal under every circumstance, I never thought you would be setting up such a strawman.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why?	NoArgument	test
video games				Public health.	NoArgument	test
video games				Simple.	NoArgument	test
video games				The view specifically being changed in this is that it should be banned because it's gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				I used the word OP used.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's very much not a strawman.	NoArgument	test
video games				And how is public health a simple explanation?	NoArgument	test
video games				That's quite a statement.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why would you consider that self evident?	NoArgument	test
video games				> it should be banned because it's gambling    Banned form video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				This doesn't affect gambling outside of video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your strawman is asking why should gambling be banned, and that is not what OP said.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Why would you consider that self evident?	NoArgument	test
video games				Where did I say self-evident?	NoArgument	test
video games				Another strawman?	NoArgument	test
video games				I said it's simple that gambling is a risk to public health and as other risks it should be regulated (such as banning it for minors like tobacco, alcohol and sex).	NoArgument	test
video games				What part don't you understand, why gambling is a risk to public health, or why risks to public health should be heavily regulated?	NoArgument	test
video games				You're being very aggressive here.	NoArgument	test
video games				The title is that loot boxes are gambling and should be banned.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then said this:  >  Gambling is illegal in most states and illegal under US law.	NoArgument	test
video games				Therefore, should be removed from video games and apps.	NoArgument	test
video games				Go ahead and try to change my view.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you honestly think I'm strawmanning OP, we can't have any kind of discourse because you're reading these things very differently.	NoArgument	test
video games				> Where did I say self-evident?	NoArgument	test
video games				Another strawman?	NoArgument	test
video games				You didn't say "self-evident" but it seems fairly self evident to me that if you feel that stating "public health" is any kind of an argument, you must consider a lot about that to be self evident.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm tired of defending stupid attacks from you so I'm done responding.	NoArgument	test
video games				Maybe you can be less aggressive in the future and we can have a useful exchange but this is not it.	NoArgument	test
video games				I am attacking your arguments, don't be such a snowflake.	NoArgument	test
video games				OP says gambling should be banned from.games because it is banned in most of US.	NoArgument	test
video games				You asked why gambling should be banned.	NoArgument	test
video games				OP didn't say gambling should be banned.	NoArgument	test

video games				I'll go ahead and disagree with you that lootboxes have ruined anything.	NoArgument	test
video games				In a "free gaming app", the app is free.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, if you pay money you'll get more out of the game, just like if you pay more to see your favorite sport you will get better seats, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Yes, there may be games which give you an inherent bonus for paying money.	NoArgument	test
video games				But, you are able to play the game for free or less than actual cost, aren't you?	NoArgument	test
video games				Do you really want to pay the $120+ to that it *actually* costs for these AAA games?	NoArgument	test
video games				And, why should you have to?	NoArgument	test
video games				If someone is willing to subsidize my playing, why the hell am I going to stop them?	NoArgument	test
video games				Why should it be illegal?	NoArgument	test
video games				The whales are essentially paying to have participants in their game.	NoArgument	test
video games				We, the sponges who don't pay for shit, are basically the product.	NoArgument	test
video games				And that's fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can choose to participate, or not, just like you can pay or not.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can also pay within your means-- if you make minimum wage, you still get to have fun and participate.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you have 10 million dollars, why shouldn't you get to pay as much as you want for the product?	NoArgument	test
video games				This is the perfect payment system.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's shitty to price poor people out of video games.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think it's awesome that you can test a game for free, and decide if it's something you want to contribute money to.	NoArgument	test
video games				I also inherently disagree that a lootbox is automatically gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling usually involves games of chance, but not all games of chance are gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				If the item you receive has no monetary, resale value, then it's not gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				Lootboxes in games like Overwatch, for instance, are not gambling-- the moment they turn off their servers, all of your items are gone.	NoArgument	test
video games				They don't belong to you, because they don't exist.	NoArgument	test
video games				Gambling is addictive because it is fun and exciting.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think you could remove the most exploitative nature of loot boxes without banning them all together.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, loot boxes could be free and you get them simply for logging in each day.	NoArgument	test
video games				No option to buy them.	NoArgument	test
video games				Why ban that?	NoArgument	test
video games				Even with purchasing loot boxes, if you limit people to spending, say $2/week, again I don't see a problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's a mechanism a lot of people enjoy and enjoy a lot, which is absolutely part of the problem, but you don't have to let it be a problem.	NoArgument	test
video games				I agree that it is gambling but it teaches an excellent life lesson at low cost.	NoArgument	test
video games				One of the problems we have as a society today is that we do not give kids and young people enough room to make silly stupid mistakes when the consequences of those mistakes (most of the time) are so small.	NoArgument	test
video games				Mistakes like learning about how gambling is a game but where you lost most of the time is important to learn when they are spending pennies instead of later in life when doing it with hundreds.	NoArgument	test
video games				So I say let them learn this lesson at this low cost and they will have this to carry with them when they get older and will see consequences from what they decide to do.	NoArgument	test
video games				The only issue I really have with this is that game publishers have increasingly shown that microtransactions are a slippery slope for them, and the are only too happy to lay down some grease on the hill.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think that if microtransactions were limited to exactly what you are describing, that might be okay, but I have very little confidence on the game industry's ability to restrain themselves from finding more sinister avenues to monetization.	NoArgument	test
video games				Understandable.	NoArgument	test
video games				I believe that good microtransaction models exist.	NoArgument	test
video games				But in a profit driven world, especially where you have to almost be tied to a AAA publisher if you want a chance at success, it makes sense that publishers ensure a way for their product to increase it's bottom line and thereby return rewards for their stock investors.	NoArgument	test
video games				Not to get too political, but this issue is more of a capitalistic one than anything else, specifically the idea of profit for the sake of profit.	NoArgument	test
video games				But good models do exist in various ways as I hoped to have highlighted.	NoArgument	test
video games				They are fine if the game is in good shape and doesn't have any major issues that need addressing first	NoArgument	test
video games				Well microtransactions are normally handled by a different team than those focusing on gameplay.	NoArgument	test
video games				At least from the articles I have read.	NoArgument	test
video games				And sometimes the publishers take over them from the developers so they can adjust bottom line predictions for stock prices and returns.	NoArgument	test
video games				But I understand your take.	NoArgument	test
video games				> also instills confidence, that you will want to play game for the game's sake, and not for an externally enforced purpose.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think the opposite is true, and its why I don't think microtransactions are fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				They've turned every game into some variant of a collection game, where time spent in a game increases your access to things.	NoArgument	test
video games				This causes people to stick with games because they feel invested,  and to grind out games even when they do not want to play so as not to miss out on rewards.	NoArgument	test
video games				For example, logging in just to do your daily quests and get your lootbox rewards.	NoArgument	test
video games				The net impact is people not playing games for the game's sake, and gameplay being less pure.	NoArgument	test
video games				Another factor to consider is the content creation itself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Admittedly this kind of goes into "depending on the model" because Dota2 proves it is possible, but the vast majority of games no longer let you create content like they used to.	NoArgument	test
video games				The perfect example of this being Call of Duty.	NoArgument	test
video games				CoD4 had some nice custom maps.	NoArgument	test
video games				More recent CoD games have map packs as microtransactions, why let you play fan created maps when they can sell you their own, including simple ports of older maps?	NoArgument	test
video games				Dota2 does that right by letting fans make content and that then gets sold through the microtrans model, but dota2 is such a huge anomaly there.	NoArgument	test
video games				Then there is client side customization, like setting enemy models to the full bright green skin in quake,  or at least disabling all enemy skins/models and forcing defaults in many multiplayer games.	NoArgument	test
video games				If people are paying for microtransactions, they want to force others to have to see it, even if others find it annoying or laggy.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well I suppose 2 things are at odds here the way you describe it, but would seem only acknowledge the existence of one of them: firstly the human nature to want things, especially the things that pertain to our desires and that is pitted against the ability to manipulate or push that desire for another cause.	NoArgument	test
video games				Meaning: "We like games.	NoArgument	test
video games				We like things that enhance our games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Give us those things."  Vs: "We'll give you those things.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can get them the long way or the quick way.	NoArgument	test
video games				One costs time, the other costs money."  I have no doubt that lots of market research goes into how to get players to spend money both in the point of sale of a game and in the aftermath of it's release.	NoArgument	test
video games				But is a company at fault for realizing that they can make money off of another's desire to instantly have more fun on the thing someone is already having fun on?	NoArgument	test
video games				A friend of mine called it, "greed abusing impatience." Both have to be present for one to use the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				It makes sense to be against loot boxes because its demonstrably a form of gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				But cosmetic microtransactions as a whole?	NoArgument	test
video games				We've had DLC maps long before CoD4.	NoArgument	test
video games				And even in CoD4, the first DLC was 3 maps for 12 bucks or something.	NoArgument	test
video games				And another.	NoArgument	test
video games				And another.	NoArgument	test
video games				No new cosmetics, guns, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				Just maps.	NoArgument	test
video games				And if you bought them all, you had paid nearly 100 dollars for a game in 2007-08.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nowadays, many games will give away maps and weapons for free, especially of profits are being made on cosmetics.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell all of Mass Effect 3, Halo 5, and other games content was free because of the amount made from microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				My point in my main argument is that microtransactions are the reality now.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that doesn't make them inherently bad (as I compared to GMOs).	NoArgument	test
video games				It means they can be applied in a way thats harmful and greedy, but can also be applied in ways that enhance the game for many players while adding to its longevity.	NoArgument	test
video games				This whole post boils down to asking politely that developers and publishers put you on a very comfortable hamster wheel or in a Skinner box.	NoArgument	test
video games				Microtransactions exist solely to get money from you.	NoArgument	test
video games				Have you thought about why they're always cosmetic?	NoArgument	test
video games				Why cosmetics have always been the main thing?	NoArgument	test
video games				They're designed to get you to want to stand out - especially in multiplayer games that rely on social interaction.	NoArgument	test
video games				The idea that they're somehow more acceptable because one can avoid them is like saying drugs aren't bad because you can avoid them, but both prey on people's weaknesses in some sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				Microtransactions are barely comparable to drugs but only in terms of severity.	NoArgument	test
video games				They still operate the same way.	NoArgument	test
video games				Developers are putting so much time and energy into reskinning games and developing these things that don't matter but in the long run, developers won't pursue games or ideas unless they can get money from them.	NoArgument	test
video games				That means publishers are controlling entire markets just to make money in this specific way.	NoArgument	test
video games				You think it's just a matter of not buying them but it's a crass move to ask people mid-game to make a purchase, and it's pervasive.	NoArgument	test
video games				Look at *StarCraft*.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's really not getting updates or anything in the series because it can't be monetized, but the original series never struggled with that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Players repeatedly reject these games but they're funded based on whales.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's not a requirement to be in a hamster wheel.	NoArgument	test
video games				I did 3 things in my original post.	NoArgument	test
video games				Firstly, I established what I believe would be the most ideal way to implement microtransactions that would strike a balance in revenue for the publisher/developer and enjoyment for customer.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly I established ways that microtransactions enhance the game for many.	NoArgument	test
video games				And thirdly, I established that they are a reality that is not necessary but one that isn't going away.	NoArgument	test
video games				As far as if I ever stopped to think about why they were cosmetics, well of course!	NoArgument	test
video games				The only other option to cosmetic though are things that are game impacting (unless you know of another category).	NoArgument	test
video games				So of the 2, I think we all can agree that of microtransactions are going to exist, the least harm they will generate on a game is in the form of cosmetics, I'd argue.	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't think games like Starcraft aren't getting updates because they can't be monetized.	NoArgument	test
video games				The RTS genre is all but dead at this point with maybe one meaningful and successful title a year released, if that.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is the same company (Blizzard) that is offering up Vanilla WoW for free in the subscription butbalso charges 25 bucks for an anniversary mount the same year.	NoArgument	test
video games				If they wanted to monetize Starcraft, they could.	NoArgument	test
video games				But the genre isn't popular and the game isn't popular.	NoArgument	test
video games				So they generate interest by releasing HD classics.	NoArgument	test
video games				Vanilla WoW, Warcraft 3, Brood War, and older Diablos all have gotten or are getting remade or re-released.	NoArgument	test
video games				All while supporting their main money-making IPs in WoW, OW, and Hearthstone.	NoArgument	test
video games				Overwatch is another example of a tradeoff from thebdays of DLC map packs such as in CoD4 example you mentioned.	NoArgument	test
video games				All OW's gameplay content is free.	NoArgument	test
video games				New maps, characters, modes, and even PvE events.	NoArgument	test
video games				All free to the player.	NoArgument	test
video games				The tradeoff is that cosmetics are behind lootboxes.	NoArgument	test
video games				If we were to rewind time, the cost would be on the maps, characters, modes, and events and you'd be luck if you got skins and cosmetics.	NoArgument	test
video games				Again, I'm not making the claim that microtransactions are great.	NoArgument	test
video games				But to accept them as the reality, because they are.	NoArgument	test
video games				To defy it would be to defy capitalism, which I'm all for but that's another topic entirely.	NoArgument	test
video games				Since we have to accept it, it makes sense to realize that like any othet tech or capability, it can be used for good, for a balance, and nefariously (like my GMO comparison).	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no ideal way to implement microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's really the end of it.	NoArgument	test
video games				You're trying to defend a practice that is designed by [people like this, giving this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4&t=19s).	NoArgument	test
video games				It's founded on behavioral psychology.	NoArgument	test
video games				I highly recommend you watch all of that.	NoArgument	test
video games				>But to accept them as the reality, because they are.	NoArgument	test
video games				In no way is this the post because it makes no sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				These kinds of posts are removed.	NoArgument	test
video games				It has nothing to do with capitalism.	NoArgument	test
video games				Capitalism is often used as an excuse not to think and just trust that money is going to the right places, but it isn't.	NoArgument	test
video games				I've seen this video along with several other TED-ish talks about the human psyche and the concept of consumerism and desire.	NoArgument	test
video games				This is nothing new though, when it comes to market research.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's been around for a while.	NoArgument	test
video games				The entire field of marketing is dedicated to finding out how to manipulate a population to spend money.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's just that there's never been more data than now, and with a commodity like a video game, data gathering has never been easier.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm not defending predatory practices.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm trying to highlight that these concepts in market research have been a thing as long as we have been able to hold data on consumers, which goes back even before computers.	NoArgument	test
video games				> In no way is this the post because it makes no sense.	NoArgument	test
video games				These kinds of posts are removed.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well the mods are very active on here and haven't removed it, so that's a no.	NoArgument	test
video games				And quoting one line out of context does not define my post.	NoArgument	test
video games				As I have said elsewhere here, my post accomplishes 3 things or makes 3 contentions.	NoArgument	test
video games				Firstly that microtransactions are a reality and unless you are going to ban them, they aren't going away.	NoArgument	test
video games				Secondly that they are not inherently bad, but can be used badly or well, providing several examples of both and even using the analogy of GMOs.	NoArgument	test
video games				Thirdly, I established ways in which microtransactions are good.	NoArgument	test
video games				And so far, I have yet to see a counter argument that holds water.	NoArgument	test
video games				Such as what I perceive to be  your goal-post moving from the idea that cosmetics couldn't possibly keep people interested in a game which I refuted to know focusing on using the human psyche to spend more money.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that brings me to a different point, far from my original claim, but here we are.	NoArgument	test
video games				It has just about everything to do with capitalism.	NoArgument	test
video games				They make a product and they market people to buy it, and then market them to keep spending money on it.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you support a capitalistic economy, there is literally nothing wrong here.	NoArgument	test
video games				There's no fraud, embezzlement, etc.	NoArgument	test
video games				With lootboxes, you could make an argument for gambling.	NoArgument	test
video games				But without lootboxes, microtransactions are not a predatory practice in most cases.	NoArgument	test
video games				There are some that are egregious and some that are very lenient and player friendly.	NoArgument	test
video games				But these are all under capitalism.	NoArgument	test
video games				"Buy this overpriced shirt and you will look cool in front of your friends" is no different than "buy this glow-y skin and you will look cool as you play your game." You don't need the fancy name-brand shirt.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have shirts.	NoArgument	test
video games				They are fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				But you want the cool shirt, because you want to look cool or express yourself.	NoArgument	test
video games				Same with skins and cosmetics in games.	NoArgument	test
video games				Both are plays on the human psyche, the need to look and feel appreciated/exceptional/whatever, and both claim to sell that need to someone.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's just that one may be more subtle than the other.	NoArgument	test
video games				> There's no ideal way to implement microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				That's really the end of it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Well that's a claim and not an argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				I described what I think is the ideal way.	NoArgument	test
video games				If you're only argument is that they shouldn't exist, then fine.	NoArgument	test
video games				But they don't defy any current laws or regulations, so you'll need to make new ones.	NoArgument	test
video games				And regulating capitalism is rarely seen as a pro-capitalism move.	NoArgument	test
video games				But if you don't/won't argue to remove them, then you'll have to argue against my ideal implementation of microtransactions or come up with your own.	NoArgument	test
video games				Otherwise, I don't think you're arguing anything here.	NoArgument	test
video games				I get that you don't like the microtransactions.	NoArgument	test
video games				And I get that's what most people are saying in the comments thus far.	NoArgument	test
video games				But that's not an argument.	NoArgument	test
video games				At this point it feels like when someone defends eugenics but without all that negative stuff.	NoArgument	test
video games				You can't separate these claims, you're just saying wouldn't it be nice if people with all this information just didn't use it.	NoArgument	test
video games				Supporting capitalism absolutely does not mean accepting whatever companies do.	NoArgument	test
video games				A huge part of capitalism is trying to affect companies.	NoArgument	test
video games				Wow man...	NoArgument	test
video games				I laid out my whole argument plain as day, refute all your responses even though they don't address my argument, and then you compare my argument to eugenics.	NoArgument	test
video games				I think that says a lot.	NoArgument	test
video games				I never make an attempt to separate the claims.	NoArgument	test
video games				I clearly state that they can be implemented and have been in bad ways.	NoArgument	test
video games				I also have shown how the mere existence of them is not a bad thing and is and can be good.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have not refuted that.	NoArgument	test
video games				You have not addressed the majority of what I have said.	NoArgument	test
video games				Even with the capitalism claim, I'm not saying you support capitalism unadulterated, but that under current laws and regulations, nothing they are doing goes against that.	NoArgument	test
video games				Hell, even stores and shops do this.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your average Kroger-affiliated grocery store will sell you everything, but if you sign up to their club and register your shopping habits with them, they'll give you cheaper prices, even though other stores just sell them at the cheaper price without a membership.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's all over.	NoArgument	test
video games				Now video games do it to.	NoArgument	test
video games				But apparently, it's only a problem when video games do it.	NoArgument	test
video games				So while I appreciate your time, unless you're actually going to make an argument or refute mine, I think we are done here.	NoArgument	test
video games				You commented on my responses - you didn't refute them.	NoArgument	test
video games				They're your opinion.	NoArgument	test
video games				My parallel is also very accurate and succinct (if we're just allowed to verify our own opinions).	NoArgument	test
video games				I don't need to write a lot to make points like these.	NoArgument	test
video games				This issue is shut in my book.	NoArgument	test
video games				Your third and fourth arguments for why microtransactions can be good are not achievable with your criteria that all microtransactions should be strictly cosmetic.	NoArgument	test
video games				The biggest factor that drives players to want more content and to want to keep going back to a game is the gameplay, if a game is interesting and fun people will play it no matter how generic their character looks.	NoArgument	test
video games				You said it yourself microtransactions should be cosmetic only with no impact on gameplay, how is something that is supposed to have no impact on gameplay supposed to enhance a player’s gameplay experience enough for them to want to keep playing a game that might not be worth the time?	NoArgument	test
video games				LOL has done it for years.	NoArgument	test
video games				I'm sorry but I don't follow.	NoArgument	test
video games				In regards to your first paragraph, it would seem demonstrably false.	NoArgument	test
video games				Nearly every MOBA falls under the idea that cosmetic changes will keep people coming back.	NoArgument	test
video games				Dota has passed it's own record by crowdfunding their International tournament (going on now) by using a fraction of the proceeds from cosmetic purchases from players.	NoArgument	test
video games				That tournament prize pool is now past 30 million (making it largest prize pool for esports ever and largest payout to individual players ever for the champions.	NoArgument	test
video games				In fact, most games offer mainly or exclusively cosmetic updates, so I don't think this is correct.	NoArgument	test
video games				Additionally, as I stated in point 4, these cosmetic sales keep the game alive both for the player's enjoyment, the developers cost, and the publisher's profits.	NoArgument	test
video games				Everyone wins.	NoArgument	test
video games				Some win more than others, but everyone wins.	NoArgument	test
video games				In regards to your 2nd paragraph on cosmetics, it already happens.	NoArgument	test
video games				It enhances your gameplay because now you look cooler/better/how-you-want while playing the game.	NoArgument	test
video games				It's quite simple:  1.	NoArgument	test
video games				One enjoys playing a game.	NoArgument	test
video games				2.	NoArgument	test
video games				One enjoys playing a game where they get to choose how they look more.	NoArgument	test
video games				3.	NoArgument	test
video games				One enjoys playing a game where they get to choose how they look and how their powers/equipment looks even more.	NoArgument	test
video games				4.	NoArgument	test
video games				Continue.	NoArgument	test
video games				If anything you said was true, then cosmetic sales wouldn't be working right now in the majority of games.	NoArgument	test
